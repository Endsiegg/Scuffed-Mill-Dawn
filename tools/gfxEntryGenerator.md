<h1>How to use gfx_entry_generator.py for goals</h1>
<h5>For whoever on gfx-input branch using this script:</h5>

1) Open powershell/cmd

2) Go into Millennium_Dawn/tools folder

3) Run command 'python3 gfx_entry_generator.py'

4) Give the complete path to the gfx entry. Which means you need to jump out of the tools folder and the Millennium_Dawn folder when giving the path.
With this in mind, the path you give should look like this: 

    ' ..\ ..\Millennium_Dawn\gfx\interface\goals '

5) You will be asked to enter the mod folder name. Typically you would want to enter: 'Millennium_Dawn\' 

6) Enter '1' to generate goals.gfx

7) Next, enter '0'. (We dont append 'GFX' in front of the goals icons)
    
8) New goals.gfx and goals_shine.gfx should now be generated

9) To view if the files changed run git command: git status

10) Check what changes are made with git command: git differ

11) Everything looks good? Now commit and push :)
