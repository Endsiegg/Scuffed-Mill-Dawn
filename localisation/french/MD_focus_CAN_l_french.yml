Auditor General Sheila Fraser just finished a report on the program, and it has been revealed to the nation that almost half of the $250 million program was spent on corporations friendly to the Liberals.

These attacks would have involved bombing cultural landmarks, opening fire on crowds in the streets of Toronto, taking out power grids, invading the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, storming the headquarters of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and even launching an assault on Parliament Hill.

Some say that this only serves to revive separatist sentiments, and that Quebec does not deserve special treatment. Others see this as a positive step forward in Canada’s relationship with Quebec by recognizing the things that make their province unique.

The activists there are calling for action on issues with land claims, the quality of life on reservations, and social service programs available to them. One of their most pressing concerns is the cancellation of the Kelowna Accord by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It was a series of agreements between the federal government and indigenous peoples which sought to improve education, employment, and living conditions through government-sponsored programs.

Elections Canada is normally supposed to refund some of a party’s expenses in each riding based on the votes they received, but they withheld this due to the scandal. Today, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided the Conservative headquarters in search of documents pertaining to the illegal funding.

G20 summits seem to attract the attention of many political activists. All the world’s most influential leaders are gathered in one place, and this is a chance for them to have their voices heard. Thousands showed up on the streets to peacefully protest against a perceived lack of transparency and care for public opinion. Rioters among them took advantage of the large crowds to vandalize buildings, loot shops, and set some vehicles ablaze. Many riot police were sent out to put an end to the anarchy, but a lack of leadership lead to some violent clashes involving innocent bystanders.

However, the deal is not without controversy. There are growing concerns to do with the terms on intellectual property laws, genetically modified organisms, and visa restrictions between the two signatories. Newfoundland and Labrador in particular is upset with the way the enforcement of our exclusive economic zone will be altered.

 canada_md_politics.20.d: "Ottawa is currently under lockdown after a lone gunman attempted an attack on the government. It began with him fatally wounding a sentry named Corporal Nathan Cirilo at the National War Memorial. He then made his way to the Parliament, and entered the Centre Block through the main entrance under the Peace Tower. Many Members of Parliament were holding meetings at the time, and were gathered in rooms that the gunman happened to run past. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in one of these rooms, and was forced to hide in a closet as his fellow party members grabbed flagpoles to defend themselves. The gunman shot some rounds as he made his way through the halls, and one bullet flew into the room the NDP were gathered in. Eventually, the RCMP managed to corner the gunman behind a column. Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers dove past the gunman while firing at him, and Constable Curtis Barrett reportedly shot the fatal bullet. Already, news stations around the world have begun sensationalizing this event with reports of the city being under siege. Even calmer reporters are questioning the lack of security on Parliament Hill. Perhaps the Americans were right to increase surveillance as much as they did after facing terror attacks of their own"

 canada_md_politics.21.d: "The Liberals have just won an election with the promise of ending our airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. What they want to do instead is put more effort into training our allies on the ground to build a more effective fighting force. One reason for this move is that it will save costs, as we have already spent hundreds of millions on our combat operations. Another is that Canadians would not have to put their lives at risk if local forces were able to handle their own battles. There is some merit to both these arguments, but we risk upsetting our NATO allies. Other nations might get the impression that we are making them do all the heavy lifting."

 canada_md_politics.22.d: "Omar Khadr has become quite a divisive figure in the nation. His father took him to Afghanistan as a boy, and he ended up fighting on the side of Al-Qaeda along with other terrorist groups during the war. He was wounded in a battle against American forces, and allegedly killed a Sergeant 1st Class by the name of Christopher Speer with a grenade. Later, he was captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay where he was interrogated by American and Canadian intelligence officers. In 2010, he pled guilty to war crimes after 8 years in custody. He returned to Canada to serve the rest of his term here. Controversy arose from his treatment at Guantanamo Bay. The UN has found that he is the first person since World War II to be prosecuted for war crimes as a minor. Civil rights activists across the nation voiced disdain for the actions of our intelligence services, and the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they violated his human rights. Khadr was released on bail in 2015, but the Conservatives sought to appeal this decision. The new Liberal administration is now considering dropping this appeal. Canadians will surely react negatively either way this goes."

 canada_md_politics.23.d: "Our aerospace industry is hurting, and that has led to some desperate measures by Bombardier. Their newest passenger jet, the CSeries, fills a niche in the market which could potentially bring them fortune. However, not many companies have been buying these jets. In response, Bombardier slashed the price on each well below the production cost to make them more enticing. Each jet is being sold for $19 million despite costing $33 million to produce. Boeing did not like this one bit, as it presented tough competition for their MAX 7. Thus, they filed a petition against Bombardier. It is somewhat hypocritical that they are accusing Bombardier of unfair economic advantages when they themselves receive massive tax breaks from the American government. Nonetheless, this could be a death blow to our aerospace industry. It does not help that the current American administration has been accusing us of taking advantage of our trade relationship. Luckily, Europe has come to our aid. Airbus wants to acquire a majority stake in the CSeries program in exchange for exclusive benefits to Canada. The Europeans are trustworthy allies, but we will not be nearly as independent in this industry if we take the offer."

 canada_md_politics.25.d: "Our military and allies in NATO have been persistently asking our administration to spend more on security. They make a good argument too. Our military has been struggling to keep up with the times these past few decades. Hardware is outdated, and recruitment is on the decline. We have also been deploying our forces to an increasing number of conflict zones overseas. Our sovereignty in the north will also need to be protected as the ice continues to melt. Defense minister Harjit Sajjan has put forward a new defense policy to tackle these concerns. It calls for an overhaul of the military over the next 20 years, and this includes a 73% increase to spending over the next decade. This plan will be costly, and it is unclear where all the resources necessary will come from."
 canada_md_politics.25.a: "Canada must do more to protect herself and her allies."
 canada_md_politics.25.b: "The military is capable enough already."
 canada_md_politics.26.t: "Canada 150 Celebrations"
 canada_md_politics.26.d: "It has been 150 years since Canadian Confederation. The federal and provincial governments are hosting the largest celebrations in the country’s history. Shows are being put on, national parks are free to access, and commemorative coins have been minted. We also have a giant duck swimming around Lake Ontario. Some of our friends across the world have sent gifts too. The Dutch have bred a tulip that looks just like the Maple Leaf flag. Despite all this, not everyone is excited today. Some are criticizing the high cost of the festivities, and they would rather see the money put elsewhere. Indigineous groups assert that the sesquicentennial only reinforces hundreds of years of colonial rule. Both these points have caused a bit of tension among Canadians."
 canada_md_politics.26.a: "What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore the world."
