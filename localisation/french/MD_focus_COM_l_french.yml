 COM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The Comorosi island chain has an idyllic countryside. Jungles covers the mountains and the volcano Karthala. Its on the coast where most people live simple lives as fishermen, the country's single greatest revenue. Not always is it peaceful on these islands. Coups are common occurance and unruly governors try their best for more autonomy. Comoros does share a lot with its cultural neighbour Tanzania, except its majority muslim and all exclusivly speak a dialect of Kiswahili.\n\nThe country has an interesting view on the french overseas department of Mayotte. Irredentists claim it as part of the nation though the people in Mayotte doesn't seem to share that view."
 COM_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Comoros has seen its fair share of action. In 2008 the invasion to take back control of Anjouan was a success. Many citizens regrettably live in poor lives with many fleeing to Mayotte in search for a better life. There's some good prospectsfor a membership in the East African Community. This can greatly improve investment opportunities to come to Comoros and raise the living standards for thousands. Most likely this country will live life with business as usual."
