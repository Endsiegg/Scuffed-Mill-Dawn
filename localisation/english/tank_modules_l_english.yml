Use them if you want to prioritise soft attack over hard attack§!"

 tank_medium_cannon: "Early Cold War Medium Tank Gun"
 tank_medium_cannon_desc: "With development of composite armor, a bigger gun was needed to pierce more armour than a light tank gun. While the Soviet Union started with a 115 mm gun on the T-62, they quickly upgraded to a 125 mm main gun. Western countries quickly followed suit with their 120 mm gun. The medium tank gun has been the most common choice for tank armament ever since.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Medium caliber guns are a balanced tank gun.

Use them if you want to favour hard attack while still retaining some soft attack§!"

 tank_very_large_cannon: "Early Super Heavy Tank Gun"
 tank_very_large_cannon_desc: "This high caliber gun can destroy virtually everything. With a caliber of 152 mm, even if it won't pierce the armor, it will dislocate turrets and crack armour from a long distance.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Super heavy guns are intended to be used in anti-armour duties. Use them if you want to favour hard attack greatly over soft attack§!"
 tank_very_large_cannon_2: "Improved Super Heavy Tank Gun"
 tank_very_large_cannon_2_desc: "With latest ammo and computer development applied to existing high caliber guns, this cannon is the best army has to offer in terms of fighting armour.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Super heavy guns are intended to be used in anti-armour duties.

Use this if you value high survivability and quality over quantity for your tanks§!"
 tank_soviet_turret: "Cast Turret"
 tank_soviet_turret_desc: "A Soviet-style pan-shaped cast turret. A cast turret is cheap to manufacture and it allows the creation of a low and curved turret profile. However, this round shape makes it more difficult to utilise reactive armour and hard-to-cast composite materials.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a balanced tank turret for both offence and defence. Use this if you need a large amount of tanks and can live with favouring quantity over quality§!"
 tank_no_turret: "No Turret"
 tank_no_turret_desc: "An unorthodox design most often seen in the Swedish Stridsvagn-series, this tank is built without a turret. The gun is fixed into the hull, allowing a sleek and low profile that provides a mobile, defensive gun platform while being simpler to construct. However, the lack of free gun movement greatly limits its capabilities.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Use this if you plan to deploy cheaper tanks alongside defensive infantry§!"
 tank_oscillating_turret: "Oscillating Turret"
 tank_oscillating_turret_desc: "An unusual design where the gun is fixed into the turret, and in order to aim the gun, the entire turret rotates on a trunnion.

Use this if you want to maximise the armour that your tank has, at the slight cost of offensive capabilities§!"

 tank_torsion_bar_suspension: "Torsion Bar Suspension"
 tank_torsion_bar_suspension_desc: "A standard suspension system for tanks. Rods connected to road wheels are connected to a horizontal bar. As the wheels move up and down, the bar twists, acting as a suspension spring.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a standard safe and low-risk option§!"
 tank_pneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic suspension"
 tank_pneumatic_suspension_desc: "In a hydropneumatic suspension, a combination of hydraulic fluid and nitrogen gas are used as dampening elements of the suspension. With this suspension, the tank rides much more smoothly. The drive height can be adjusted on the fly and the tank has the ability to self level. This allows smoother movement and more stable aiming. However, as a suspension system it is more difficult to manufacture and maintan than a classic torsion bar system.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Equipping your tank with a hydropneumatic suspension makes your tank better overall at the cost of reliability and production cost§!"

 tank_steel_armor_gen1: "Early Steel Armour"
 tank_steel_armor_gen1_desc: "Early rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) used on first generation main battle tanks.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Steel armour is a low budget armour option for tanks. It won't hold up to modern composite armour§!"

 tank_composite_armor_gen2: "Cold War Composite Armour"
 tank_composite_armor_gen2_desc: "By replacing the silica glass with plastic reinforced glass (fibreglass) and by adding ceramic corundum plates, the strength of the armour is greatly increased.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Composite armour is the standard option for modern main battle tanks§!"
 tank_composite_armor_gen3: "Modern Composite Armour"
 tank_composite_armor_gen3_desc: "Modern composite armour consists of ceramic tiles inside a metal honeycomb pattern with elastic plates installed on both sides, and the covered with armour plating. Modern armour offers great protection from traditional kinetic penetrators as well as shaped charges.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Composite armour is the standard option for modern main battle tanks§!"
 tank_composite_armor_gen4: "Advanced Composite Armour"
 tank_composite_armor_gen4_desc: "3D-printing, laser sintering and nanoscale alumina powder with carbon nanotubes provides state of the armour protection for our tanks.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Composite armour is the standard option for modern main battle tanks§!"

 smoke_launchers_2: "Improved Smoke Launchers"
 smoke_launchers_2_desc: "Improved chemical formula covers vehicle from infra-red sights as well.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Adding smoke launchers reduces the visibility of our tank, making it better in both defence and offence§!"

 reactive_armor_gen1: "1st Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen1_desc: "Explosive reactive armour (ERA) composes of bricks made of explosives on a metal frame installed on the tank. As the brick is hit by a kinetic penetrator or a shaped charge, the brick explodes, countering the incoming projectile. The first experiments were done in the 60s to counter early shaped charges, but none made it to production.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"
 reactive_armor_gen2: "2nd Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen2_desc: "By increasing the size of the ERA bricks and adding more explosives and a thicker frame, the explosive force can be increased to counter even kinetic penetrators.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"
 reactive_armor_gen3: "3rd Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen3_desc: "With a new structure, ERA can be improved to withstand both kinetic penetrators and shaped charges better. It can even offer protection from tandem shaped charges that are specifically designed to counter ERA.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"
 reactive_armor_gen4: "4th Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen4_desc: "Most advanced form of ERA, capable of operating in various environmental conditions and able to reduce the efficiency of most incoming fire.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"

 spaced_armor_gen1: "Early Spaced Armour"
 spaced_armor_gen1_desc: "Spaced armour is an armour system where there is an additional armour plate on top of the main armour with a gap in between. The outer plate will cause a shaped charge to detonate early, reducing it's penetration depth. Early spaced armour is just thin armour plates.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Spaced armour is a budget version of explosive reactive armour to give your tank more protection§!"
 spaced_armor_gen2: "Improved Spaced Armour"
 spaced_armor_gen2_desc: "By changing the solid steel plates into a mesh or a cage like structure, we can still protect our tanks from incoming warheads with less weight.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Spaced armour is a budget version of explosive reactive armour to give your tank more protection§!"

 additional_machine_guns: "Top-Mounted Heavy Machinegun"
 additional_machine_guns_desc: "A heavy machine gun mounted on top of the turret. Mainly intended for limited anti-air duties, but can also be used against ground targets if needed.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Adding a heavy machine gun is a cheap way of slightly increasing the tanks capacities against hostile aircraft and soft targets§!"

 wet_ammo_storage: "Blow-Out Panels"
 wet_ammo_storage_desc: "In case of a catastrophic ammo explosion, it is good to design the tank with predetermined weak points in mind. This way the blast will be directed outside of the tank rather than into the crew compartment.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Blow-out are a good way to improve the survivability of your tank§!"

 automatic_loading: "Autoloading System"
 automatic_loading_desc: "In an autoloading system commonly found on Soviet and Russian tanks, a mechanical lift automatically pulls a new round into the gun. Because of this, the rounds are often stored in a carousel under or near the gun. In a tank with an autoloader the crew has to share the compartment with live ammo. While an autoloader gives a much better rate of fire than manual loading, a penetrating hit will often cook-off the ammo and burn the tank and its crew to a crisp.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: An autoloader grants the ability of more sustained firepower on targets, but makes the vehicle more likely to be catastrophically lost when damaged§!"
 manual_loading: "Manual Loading"
 manual_loading_desc: "With a traditional manual loading system often seen in Western tanks, a human loader loads new shells into the gun by hand. While this gives a rate of fire of about half of an autoloading system, manual loading provides the possibility of storing ammunition separate from the crew chamber. This protects the crew and the tank from a possible ammunition cook-off on hit.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is the standard loading system for any tank and a safe and low-risk option§!"
 revolver_magazine: "Revolver Magazine"
 revolver_magazine_desc: "An odd design of French origin. In the early Cold War, France experimented with equipping tanks with preloaded ammunition magazines. These revolver-style magazines would be stored at the back of the turret and feed the gun as it was fired. This allowed for an incredibly high rate of fire for the duration of a few rounds. However, the system could only be loaded from outside the tank, making the job of the loader the worst on the battlefield. The system never gained mainstream popularity.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: A revolver style loader allows you to maximise the damage you do to your enemies. However, the complicated reloading system makes sustaining an offensive difficult§!"

 hardkill_system_gen1: "Early Hard-Kill System"
 hardkill_system_gen1_desc: "Hard-kill system is an active defensive measure mounted on a tank. The system detects incoming projectiles and counters them with its own. The counter projectile can be a rocket, missile or a kinetic projectile. Early hard-kill systems mainly protect the tank from shaped charges.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: A hard-kill system is a good way to bolster our tanks armour to be stronger§!"
 hardkill_system_gen2: "Improved Hard-Kill System"
 hardkill_system_gen2_desc: "An improved hard-kill system will be able to stop even fast moving kinetic penetrators and tandem shaped charges. The improved system also covers the tank from all directions.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: A hard-kill system is a good way to bolster our tanks armour to be stronger§!"

 smoothbore_atgm_gen1: "Early Cold War Smoothbore ATGM"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen1_desc: "With small changes we can adopt the tank gun to fire anti-tank guided missiles. The first smoothbore ATGMs were guided via infrared seeker aligned with the gunsight or sighting telescope.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with the ability to launch ATGMs from their main gun in addition to traditional kinetic penetrators, we can increase their ability to engage enemy armoured vehicles§!"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen2: "Late Cold War Smoothbore ATGM"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen2_desc: "With laser pointed target sighting there is less distortion and the ATGM flies more accurately to the target.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with the ability to launch ATGMs from their main gun in addition to traditional kinetic penetrators, we can increase their ability to engage enemy armoured vehicles§!"

 smoothbore_atgm_gen4: "Advanced Smoothbore ATGM"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen4_desc: "By improving the tandem-charge of the ATGM warhead, we will be able to penetrate tougher enemy armour.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with the ability to launch ATGMs from their main gun in addition to traditional kinetic penetrators, we can increase their ability to engage enemy armoured vehicles§!"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen5: "Future Smoothbore ATGM"
 smoothbore_atgm_gen5_desc: "With advanced AI and algorithms, the ATGM can have a complex flight path to avoid obstacles and get the best approach angle, and even change targets mid flight if needed.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with the ability to launch ATGMs from their main gun in addition to traditional kinetic penetrators, we can increase their ability to engage enemy armoured vehicles§!"

 aa_launchers_gen1: "Early Cold War Tank Mounted SAM"
 aa_launchers_gen1_desc: "Anti-air missile launcher can be installed on the turret of the tank to provide some anti-air capability. With limited range and targeting, the early Cold War missiles are at most efficient against helicopters.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with a turret mounted anti-air missile launcher, we will get some protection from enemy aircraft§!"
 aa_launchers_gen2: "Late Cold War Tank Mounted SAM"
 aa_launchers_gen2_desc: "With a argon coolant unit to keep the infrared detector clear and a dual waveband guidance system, our missiles will have better range and accuracy.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: By equipping our tanks with a turret mounted anti-air missile launcher, we will get some protection from enemy aircraft§!"

 ITA_mbt_hull_1_desc: "The Leopard 1 is a main battle tank designed and produced by Porsche in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era."
 ITA_mbt_hull_2: "Ariete Hull"
 ITA_mbt_hull_2_desc: "The Ariete (English: battering ram) is the main battle tank of the Italian Army, developed by Consorzio Iveco Oto Melara (CIO), a consortium formed by IVECO and OTO Melara.

 ITA_mbt_hull_4: "5th Generation Tank Hull"
 ITA_mbt_hull_4_desc: "A future era tank. Main battle tanks have become less and less formidable opponents as anti-tank weaponry develops rapidly and weight in combat switches to airpower. If tanks are to survive as valid options in future wars, they will need a complete rethinking of their design and role."
