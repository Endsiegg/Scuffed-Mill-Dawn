CAS_focus_olympia_rises: "Olympia Rises"
CAS_focus_olympia_rises_desc: "With Seattle over developed the state capital of Washington will become the new national capital. Olympia has a good ring to it anyways."
CAS_focus_stabilization_of_washington: "Stabilization Of Washington"
CAS_focus_stabilization_of_washington_desc: "From establishing the federal capital of our nation and from this we can now begin to stabilize the state for which our capital now resides in. Organizing infrastructure and basic economic activity will return a form of societal cohesion which'll allow us to invest and move onto better integration efforts soon after."
CAS_focus_the_new_home: "The New Home"
CAS_focus_the_new_home_desc: "With the economic stability...for what its worth at least, as well as the cohesive efforts of our people to form a sembalence of societal structure. We now can begin the process of rolling out civil and emergency services throughout the state of Washington and begin to call this rump corner of the continent our new home."
CAS_focus_our_oregon_trail: "Our Oregon Trail"
CAS_focus_our_oregon_trail_desc: "Though the natives and settlers had to travel halfway across the continet, we must now travel south to begin the rebuilding of our neighboring territory that is Oregon state. With a base set up here in Washington we should be able to get them online in relatively short order."
CAS_focus_another_pacific_gem: "Another Pacific Gem"
CAS_focus_another_pacific_gem_desc: "With economic and social functionality restored we can begin to connect and create civil and emergency services to bind the state of Oregon to our starting place. The future grows ever more brighter, even if it is a little bit."
CAS_focus_i_dont_know: "I Don't Know?"
CAS_focus_i_dont_know_desc: "No I said Idaho, of course we didn't know the condition of the state. A whole damn mountain range encompasses a majority of the state. Regardless we can begin to revive things like the mining industry and other economic activities to give these people hope again."
CAS_focus_mountain_marvel: "Mountain Marvel"
CAS_focus_mountain_marvel_desc: "Economy, good, people, happy, state of affairs, good enough. Great. Now it's time to link up the state with the rest of the nation, from here we can begin to figure just exactly will we do in our new found place in the world."
CAS_focus_a_new_beginning: "A New Beginning"
CAS_focus_a_new_beginning_desc: "With the nation stabilized we now must look towards just exactly do we want to do. Our position means we're not really at either an advantage or disadvantage, but we'll need to act now lest things on the continent begin to heat up again."

CAS_ideas_domestic_centric_policy_desc: "Our nation is young, weak and very impressionable. Rather than be a blip in history we must focus truly on ourselves to ensure our stability, growth and the ability to gain the future for which we want in life."
CAS_ideas_rocky_mountain_resistance: "Rocky Mountain Resistance"
CAS_ideas_rocky_mountain_resistance_desc: "Despite the unity we have been able to create, the great divide that is the Rocky mountain range has embolden those who believe they are so far despite being so close. As such the union with Idaho is a tenuous one at best. We need to handle this before it begins to boil over and cause more trouble than we can handle."

  ##### Events #####
  ##################
cascadia_event.1.t: "The Resistance Rises"
cascadia_event.1.d: "Since the early days of our formation the state of Idaho has been giving us...trouble to say the least. Being the most isolated out of the three states, many within Idaho believe it would be safer and easier to just be their own entity. We don't believe it'll go anywhere but with the continued agitation many are a bit fearful of a potential conflict so soon after the chaos and anarchy which came before."
cascadia_event.1.o1: "Can't Catch A Break"
cascadia_event.2.t: "Crime Wave"
cascadia_event.2.d: "There has been a rising crime wave plaguing the state of Idaho, while this could be just hiccups in restoring over all law and order. There are just some people who are concerned for the implications this could mean. While there is no clear evidence some citizens and even ministers are prying at the government to send in a special investigative squad to secure the situation."
cascadia_event.2.o1: "Local Police Can handle This"
cascadia_event.2.o2: "Someone Get Me The Numbers On RMR Membership"
cascadia_event.3.t: "Rocky Mountain Marches"
cascadia_event.3.d: "The group known as the Rocky Mountain Resistance has begun to organize marches. While there is nothing illegal about it the rising membership of the group is causing concerns throughout Olympia. As such an order has been issued by the national government to begin a subtle mobilization as fears continue to rise over the Idaho situation."
cascadia_event.3.o1: "It Never Ends"
cascadia_event.4.t: "The Rise Of Mountain Man"
cascadia_event.4.d: "The Rocky Mountain Resistance has taken the state of Idaho and with it the leader of the group has come out. A suffed man nationed Robert \"Mountain Man\" Johnson. While he doesn't look like much, he and his group have done what many had hoped to avoid in these very young days of our nation. As such we must set forth and mobilize the nation to ensure this is handled before the world itself decides to interfere with us anymore then they've likely tried to already."
cascadia_event.4.o1: "God Help Us"
cascadia_event.5.t: "We March"
cascadia_event.5.d: "The time has come to settle this, we march through the mountains and assume the peace we have so longed for."
cascadia_event.5.o1: "We Go TO War!"
cascadia_event.300.t: "Special Investigation Unit Arrives"
cascadia_event.300.d: "A while ago after much pleading with the government in Olympia, the government dispatched a SIU to the state of Idaho. Initial investigations proved only crumbs. However as time progressed slowly co-opted crime sprees were uncovered and soon members of the RMR were detained and thankfully arrested for committing said crimes."
cascadia_event.300.o1: "Well That's Something At Least"
cascadia_event.301.t: "Crime Decreases"
cascadia_event.301.d: "As the SIU and local law enforcement continue to handle the crime wave and more and more members of the RMR are being arrested for arms theft and a plethora of other crimes. Membership numbers are beginning to dwindle as things begin to look up for the stability for the state of Idaho, many wonder just when it'll all come to a peaceable end."
cascadia_event.301.o1: "Hopefully Sooner Rather Than Later"
cascadia_event.302.t: "Continued Efforts"
cascadia_event.302.d: "As time progresses the SIU has taken more of an advisor and assistance role as local law enforcement has been given more and more operational control over the situation. Crime continues to decrease and RMR memberships have reached an all time low. Rumors have it that their leader, known simply as \"Mountain Man\", is slated to give a speech in the following days. This comes as leadership in the SIU are debating if it is finally time to leave the state as law and order seems to be mostly restored."
cascadia_event.302.o1: "It's Taken Some Time But It Was Worth It"
cascadia_event.303.t: "Peace Restored"
cascadia_event.303.d: "Earlier today the leader of the RMR announced the offical disbandment of the group. Many members were outraged but were so disheartened that they just retreated back to their homes. Local law enforcement states that crime is at an all time low and stability has once more restored itself to the state of Idaho. Now we can begin to move forward together as one nation."
