# Techs
 CZE_engine_tech: "Improved R4 Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_2: "Advanced V6 Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_2_desc: "V-type engines are generally better than the R-type engines. Thought it's worth mentioning that they drain more fuel which may be a problem in the case of war but we have to equip our vehicles with the best possible stuff."
 CZE_engine_tech_3: "TSI Improved Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_3_desc: "Our newest TSI engine version provides higher max velocity than TDI engines but at the cost of increased fuel usage."
 CZE_engine_tech_4: "TDI Improved Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_4_desc: "New TDI engine is worse than it's alternative TSI but it also drains less fuel so it was worth our research time."
 CZE_engine_tech_5: "Modern R4 Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_5_desc: "Time to get on a completely new level of engine technology. This is the best R4 version we ever created. It provides huge horsepower with a much cheaper construction cost then the competition inventions."
 CZE_engine_tech_6: "Supercharged V6 Gasoline Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_6_desc: "Another hi-tech upgrade, provides little worse stats than our second project but with greatly reduced fuel usage."
 CZE_engine_tech_7: "Extended V12 Diesel Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_7_desc: "Tatra engines fit perfect for our tanks. Their new V12 version will greatly support our land forces."
 CZE_engine_tech_8: "ISX15 Diesel Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_8_desc: "The problems with those engines is high production cost and fuel usage. But their abilities are far better than standard R4 or V6 engines."
 CZE_engine_tech_9: "Overcharged X12 Diesel Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_9_desc: "It's better to aim at highest productivity. This project will require us to produce more fuel and resources but will greatly increase performance of our tanks."
 CZE_engine_tech_10: "Lighter X12 Diesel Engine"
 CZE_engine_tech_10_desc: "We can't afford that high production and maintain costs so we'll keep the newest engines as cheapest as possible. It's still a great achievement for Tatra company."
 CZE_el_engine_tech: "Early Next-Gen Electric Engine"
 CZE_el_engine_tech_desc: "Who said that Škoda is not able to produce electric engines on its own? It's a first test of this technology but the effects may be very useful for future research."
 CZE_el_engine_tech_2: "High Voltage Electric Engine"
 CZE_el_engine_tech_2_desc: "We need to reduce some reliability if we want unleash full potential of this technology. Newest electric engine is very expensive to produce but the monstrous amount of horsepower and very low fuel cost are worth this investition."

## DECISIONS ##

 CZE_SLO_czechoslovakia_category_desc: "Czechoslovakia has been created after capitulation of the Central Powers at the end of the World War I. It quickly became one of the more stable countries in the Europe before it got annexed by the III Reich, a year before Second World War. That is when the first divide happened, when Bohemia and Moravia, and Slovak Republic states has been established. The war ended, again with a loose for Germany, and the Czechoslovakia has been restored to its borders as a Third Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nIn 1948, the Soviet Union allowed to introduce itself and established a communist regime, renaming Thrd Czechoslovak Republic to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The country followed anti-communist protests in 1989, launching Velvet Revolution and overthrowing communism. 61 years of communist subjugation managed to destabilize the country and divide the people, leading to the collapse of Czechoslovakia on December 31 1992. The Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent nations, under two different governments, borders and diplomacy.\n\nBut the people stayed the same, as well as their culture and history. The divide was inevitable a couple years in the past, but today, when the situation becomes stable again, maybe there's a chance for reconnection and with a little decisive push, two countries may become one again."

 CZE_SLO_event.2.t: "Further NATO Cooperation Program"
 CZE_SLO_event.2.d: "Our countries have to finally decide which side we should take. NATO is focused on military training and region-wide protectionism but Europe is currently a continent of peace (almost), so maybe it's worth to invest more into our police forces instead of the army."

 CZE_SLO_event.5.t: "Czechoslovakia Collapsed!"

If we sign the paper, the Czechoslovakia will be restored, and our nations will be again together under one flag."

 CZE_SLO_event.9.t: "Czechoslovakia Demands [701.GetName]"
 CZE_SLO_event.9.d: "Czehoslovakia is relatively an old country. [701.GetName] originally belonged to them when they gained independence after First World War. They've lost this territory after Second World War and it was attached to the Soviet Union. Now it's on our lands but maybe this small piece of terrain isn't worth another war."
 CZE_SLO_event.9.a: "It's theirs"
 CZE_SLO_event.9.b: "Nu uh"
 CZE_SLO_event.10.t: "Czechoslovakia Regains [701.GetName]!"
 CZE_SLO_event.10.d: "Czehoslovakia gained control over it's former territory which was forcefully taken away from them decades ago. Some people say that it's only the beginning of their demands, yet it doesn't seem very harmful at this moment..."

 CZE_SLO_event.11.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects!"

 CZE_Army_2000.01.t: "Modernize Czech APC Fleet"
 CZE_Army_2000.01.d: "The modernization of the Czech Armed Forces has become a pressing concern, and our aging fleet of Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) needs to be replaced. We must now decide whether to procure state-of-the-art models from our neighbors or develop our own indigenous design. Each choice comes with its own strategic benefits and trade-offs. Should we rely on Austria's military technology, turn to Poland for a closer regional partnership, or invest in developing our own domestic production capability?"
