We must be a new Socialist society, one which focuses on the public, their needs and the ability to create a unity in belief and understanding of cause."
 USA_political_science_reforms: "Political Science Reforms"
 USA_political_science_reforms_desc: "The ideas of politics and ideology are so confused in this supposed \"post truth\" era we live in that we must set a real standard of rationality and reason. Our scientific community with help through state mandated funding will be used to create templates of approaching sensitive subjects. The conscept of an ideology for example, an ideology is a well rounded set of beliefs stretching from both economic and social backgrounds. With this we can tell that ideologies are not left or right, but rather subjective to the individuals combined beliefs. As such the old distinction of left and right, one which was originally used to determine ones standing on economics is completely defunct in this new age of cutural and societal change as a whole. Technology in itself is a big fault for the confusion and as such we must help to better research, understand and implement new discoveries as a whole."

 USA_department_of_state_security_desc: "The DoSS will be a joint federal oversight commission which will unite the different state security branches we have within the nation. These different branches all have their own goals and fight with each other over the importance of either domestic or foreign happenings. We must put an end to this factionalism and have a united policy in approaching both sides of this coin. Formost to defend the public we must focus on the domestic issues, but to strengthen our domestic approach is to understand foreign incursions against us. We must defend our society from those who wish to strip it limb by limb from us."

 USA_socialist_militarism_desc: "The militarism of the nation has always been used for imperialist reasoning. Exploiting nations for their resources by using our military in either direct means like in iraq, or by indirect means through our extensive military base apparatus is what makes the world hate us. We must slowly decommission and retrain the modern soldier. One who understands the true values that they serve the public, the cause of Socialism, the cause of a just, fairer world.

We will work to help those who need it."

 USA_appeasing_rising_commissars_desc: "The retooling and retraining of values of our armed services has unfortunately led to the reality that even faced the old order.

 USA_appeasing_trotskyist: "Appeasing Trotskyist"
 USA_appeasing_trotskyist_desc: "The coalition has always been plagued with a strong wing of trotskyist, these radicals seek to undermine our ability to sell the values of Socialism by looking to enforce a world revolution mentality. Its this same hubris which cost the Soviets to lose the Polish Soviet War of 1921. We must create targeted language to issues that matter to them, specifically funding in security measures to boost our foreign presence. While this may not help domestically, it will make our mark on the world."

 USA_appeasing_the_anarchist_society_desc: "The Anarchist Society is a strong wing of the Socialist coalition party we hold onto.

 ##Anarchist Faction Path
 USA_weaking_global_economics: "Weakening Global Economics"
 USA_weaking_global_economics_desc: "Through the stylistic wording of protectionism we will actually be planning our decoupling from the global market. Protectionism gives people the notion they can still trade and exploit us, however we know better. Our Anarchist economics will ensure that domestic supply chains are met by domestic means. This will sure have some push pull effect overall economically speaking. But remember, slow and steady wins the race, and I think we've been moving slow enough."
 USA_the_communes_act: "The Communes Act"
 USA_the_communes_act_desc: "The Communes Act is legislation set forth to spread out and decentralize the urban centers. This will be a slow process, but the idea is to, in a way, slowly de-industrialize and return people to the vast lands which we have as a nation. These new communes can work in conjunction with already established townships and villages near their area. This will reduce the government oversight of needed services which weakens the hold the government has as well, while still stregthening the domestic defense ideal of the nation."

 USA_communal_hospitals_act_desc: "The C.H.A. is a congressional bill passed to give more medical freedom to local doctors and medically inclined persons to be able to take initiative and organize local heathcare facilities.

 USA_where_are_my_dice: "Where Are My Dice?"
 USA_where_are_my_dice_desc: "The states are wildly unpredictable when it comes to gambling and similar institutions. While some see exploitation we see economic incentives.

 USA_a_yellow_dawn: "A Yellow Dawn"
 USA_a_yellow_dawn_desc: "Our policies are radical in the eyes of the established and old guard thinkers. We must look to spread the message and solidify the Libertarian message.

The American culture of gun ownership, the free will to defend one's home and family will be used as a keystone of training and organization of military units for our Free Army. Orders will be explained to ensure that questions about them are minimal and arguments about the justness of the order is to as small of a degree as possible. Officer's will be voted for but the voting will be done according to the military aptitude of the person wanting to be voted in.

 ##Domestic Policies
 USA_decisions_domestic_policies: "Domestic Policies"
 USA_decisions_domestic_policies_desc: "The United States has a long checkered history of \"handling\", its domestic issues. While many just see this as the run of the mill congress circus, others worry that as topics become more emotional and exploitative via demagouges and media companies that it could lead to a sort of crisis flash point. Nevertheless there are topics to discuss and make decisions on. So get ready to debate."

 #List of Decisions
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_response: "Post 9/11 Response"
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_response_desc: "In the following days of the attacks which devestated our nation, we must seek out what is the correct course of action in our response. For we shall set a precedent to those who wish to do such acts of terrorism in this world and what kind of response they can expect."
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_security_concerns: "Post 9/11 Security Concerns"
 USA_decision_post_nine_eleven_security_concerns_desc: "Our security in terms of air travel as well as our nation has been lax ever since the Soviet Union fell. But this rude and sobering awakening has renewed talks about how to better ensure the security and safety of our nation at large."
 USA_decision_religious_freedoms_debate: "Religious Freedoms Debate"
 USA_decision_religious_freedoms_debate_desc: "With the terrorist attacks being perpetrated by a zealous religious sect, many agnostics and atheist are coming out and putting their two cents about what should and shouldn't be free to do religiously.

 USA_decision_school_choice_dilemma: "The School Choice Dilemma"
 USA_decision_school_choice_dilemma_desc: "Ever since the formalizing of the Department of Education and the federal education system, states themselves have always been pushing back against what some call government oversight. Nevertheless a perpetual debate over the ability to have school choice, where parents can choose to either send their kids to a private scetor based school or a public sector school has always been a sensitive topic to say the least. We must look to formalizing what should and shouldn't be allowed in terms of official education programs recognized by the national standard."
 USA_decision_the_power_grid_debate: "The Power Grid Debate"
 USA_decision_the_power_grid_debate_desc: "Our nation is a very unique one, not only does it have two main power grids, one for the eastern half and one for the western half. But guess what, the state of Texas itself has its own power grid. This whole arrangement has brought critics all around to the debate table as the organization and infrastructure which make up all these grid networks is appalling at best and a disaster waiting to happen at worst. So we must seek out what direction moving forward we want to take our electrical grid's development if we are to think of the future needs of our citizens and the nation at large."
 USA_decision_food_stamps_fiasco: "Food Stamps Fiasco"
 USA_decision_food_stamps_fiasco_desc: "The social nets of our nation are the core bread and butter for our nation's social cohesion.

 USA_decision_the_rent_crisis: "The Rent Crisis"

 USA_decision_civil_rights_contentions_desc: "Grudges and judgemental assumptions are a prime human defense mechanism against change. Regardless if the change was for good or ill humans have always been slow to change and we are seeing that even to this very day. The Civil Right Act was passed some 40+ years ago and yet we as Americans cannot seem to get along and talk out our differences with other Americans. So now we must look to deal with this stubbornness and inability to change. It'll be tough, but we must set a standard if we are to move forward, not backwards as a nation."
 USA_decision_the_marriage_question: "The Marriage Question"
 USA_decision_the_marriage_question_desc: "To be or not to be, this question seems to be asked more and more as different people consider what the idea of marriage is. Those that are god fearing say it is only between a man and a woman, while those who remember the days of the sexual revolution believe it is the bond between to loving adults. Nevertheless of what we think we must assess the population and understand where the hearts and minds lie on the issue."
 USA_decision_continued_gun_control_problems: "Continued Gun Control Problems"
 USA_decision_continued_gun_control_problems_desc: "The 2nd Amendment is the biggest political boogeyman we have in this nation next to the defense budget.

We've got to nip this in the butt if we are to focus on the real issues that affact us."
 USA_decision_rising_police_problems: "Rising Police Problems"
 USA_decision_rising_police_problems_desc: "Unchecked use of authority in local law enforcement agencies has seen a smattering of localized events which have gained national traction. This along with the growing militarization of polices forces all around the country have seen the need for the federal government to do something."
 USA_decision_healthcare_drug_transparency_debates: "The Drug Transparency Debate"
 USA_decision_healthcare_drug_transparency_debates_desc: "In recent months the rising concerns over the viability of new drugs and what their real costs are has been on the minds of your average Medicare and Medicaid user. As such constituants across the country have been petitioning and begging congress to do something about the rising crisis which is contributing, albeit a part, of the rising healthcare crisis cost in the country."
 USA_decision_healthcare_billing_troubles: "Healthcare Billing Troubles"
 USA_decision_healthcare_billing_troubles_desc: "In recent years the cost of healthcare has only gone up. This stark rise has been a political grenade as well as just a genuine problem in principle. We must figure out how to address this issue if we are to move forward and make better care institutions for our nation."
 USA_decision_social_security_not_secure: "Social Security Not Secure"
 USA_decision_social_security_not_secure_desc: "The Social Security Program is our honestly biggest political bomb in this country.

 USA_decision_police_training_troubles: "Police Training Troubles"
 USA_decision_police_training_troubles_desc: "Recent events have shown a growing aggression complex and rise in excessive use of force behavior trends in local law enforcement agencies.

 USA_decision_the_green_wave_debate: "The Green Wave Debate"
 USA_decision_the_green_wave_debate_desc: "In recent years the development as well as lobbying for renewable energy forms of energy production has gained considerable traction. This has culminated in renewed interest in the age old boogy man of politics since the dawn of modern industrialization itself. That of Climate Change, or as some may remember it as Global Warming. Regardless as technology advances so do people's understandings as well, we must figure out what stance the federal government will have on this new way forward."
 USA_decision_the_job_impact_scare: "The Job Impact Scare"
 USA_decision_the_job_impact_scare_desc: "With the recent rumblings about a \"Green Economy\" buzzing about many people are being lulled into a sense of fear due to how drastically this kind of change could have on many jobs. Similar to the automation and AI scares, many wonder how many jobs and skill sets will be nullified or made redundant of such changes. As such we need to think carefully of how to handle this kind of change, lest we wish to be voted out due to the mob mentality on the situation."
 USA_decision_the_social_impact: "The Social Impact"
 USA_decision_the_social_impact_desc: "The \"Green Economy\" will have an interesting social impact as many advocate for standardizing and forced modernization of housing both new and old. Some argue this would break many home owners and be the biggest mistake of governmental regulation since the government inaction which resulted in the Penn Central Railroad Bankruptcy back in the 1970s. others say it will be something that can be rolled out with new houses though there are concerns of the culture shock this may have on our ever aging population demographics. Regardless a choice needs to be made and made sooner rather than later."
 USA_decision_the_nuclear_question: "The Nuclear Question"
 USA_decision_the_nuclear_question_desc: "With the debates raging on about making a green econojmy, many are wondering just how we plan to make such drastic changes. One idea that keeps floating around is the revitalization and investment into our domestic nuclear capabilities. We have plenty of military capabilites, why not use the excess for civilian use. Others however fear that such an idea is another Fukashima or Three Mile Island disaster waiting to happen. Regardless we should look over what could arguably be the best outcome for what is the \"Nuclear Question\"."




 ##Reform Republic Decisions
 USA_political_and_economic_reforms: "Political And Economic Reforms"
 USA_political_and_economic_reforms_desc: "The road of life has many twist and turns, for the United States its road has been dealt a sort of circular journey. The political duopoly, rampant lobbist movements scrambling grass root movements and so forth have created a quagmire. But as the winds of change make their way through the citizenry one hopes the winds will brest the minds of political leaders. The future is a mystery indeed and it is only time who can tell us what the future beholds."

 #List of Decisions
 USA_anti_trust_department: "Department of Anti-trust Affairs"
 USA_anti_trust_department_desc: "The DoAA is set to revolutionize how we handle anti-trust cases and investigate persons or entities of interest. With a specialized department this means that the full energy of the department can be focused on the near plethora of concerns and claims being made in the day to day activities of the nation."
 USA_union_act: "4th Industrial Revolution's Act"
 USA_union_act_desc: "The Age of technology has sweeped the nation and our economy and as well as our very way of life. With this rapid change we have seen an ever increasing rise in shady business pressure tactics where everyday citizens are scrutinized or forced from their jobs by near absurd reasonings or for no reasons at all. This bill will see to getting rid of the controversial Right To Work laws and reform the ability to create unions. Many business heads in the rising tech firms have strong objections, however that sounds more of a them problem then ours at this point."
 USA_automation_act: "The Automation Progression Act"
 USA_automation_act_desc: "The APA will regulate and moderate the implimentation of automation technologies in labor intensive work environments.

 USA_safe_banking_act: "The Safe Banking Act"
 USA_safe_banking_act_desc: "The Safe Banking Act will cut and reform private investors and banking firms from tampering with individual based savings and personal earnings.

 USA_political_diversity_act: "The Political Diversity Act"
 USA_political_diversity_act_desc: "The PDA will enable the mandatory fair coverage of 3rd parties by media and ballot registration offices for all state level governing offices. This means anything state governor down that requires an election campaign will be mandatory that voting stations and media coverage of candidates is not only focused on the Republican or Democrat contender. As an addendum to the bill, voters will now be able to register what party they associate with when voting for these elections."
 USA_political_Fairness_act: "The Political Fairness Act"
 USA_political_Fairness_act_desc: "The PFA is a bill which will create a federal standard in regards to 3rd party involvement in congressional elections. A minimum requirement is that a 3rd party must have at least 1% voter registration of the voting population. This will also come with organizing each party's coverage by media outlets in order to follow their primaries and eventual candidate race members as to create a balanced coverage of all participating parties in the elections."
 USA_federal_elections_act: "The Federal Elections Act"
 USA_federal_elections_act_desc: "The FEA is critical legislation that has been needed in America since the creation of the duopoly. By enforcing voting reforms and availability the masses can now vote more efficiently and effectively. On top of that, 3rd Party candidates will be able to run for the presidency by following the same principles of the Political Fairness Act, the main difference is the requirements are now for the national voting body instead of the state by state requirement for the congressional elections. With this in mind many have begun to celebrate the Reforms that the nation has completed as with new ideas and growing means of compromising the American Eagle will soar once more."
 USA_expanded_mental_healthcare: "The Expanded Mentalcare Act"
 USA_expanded_mental_healthcare_desc: "Mental healthcare is an often neglected aspect of the larger picture of health for individuals. Insurance policies often do not cover it, and many American citizens must pay out of pocket for this care.

This new act brings the cost from the companies, the common person, and the provider to be federally regulated, ensuring quality mental healthcare for every American citizen."

 USA_focus_growing_plutocratic_influences_desc: "As time progresses and political leadership, business tycoons and rampant lobbyist work in loose coalitions to benefit one another at the expense of the many, said many are also growing more radical and distrustful. The distrust has lead to an ever increasing factional state within the supposed two party system, which has begun to lead some to more and more extreme views at the expense of rationality and pragmatism towards the real issues. Many are beginning to call this America's 2nd Gilded Age."

While some say their views are right and others argue against saying no its their views which are right. The reality is there is no real or earnestly clear answer. The complexities of such a geographically and demographically diverse nation will always create pitfalls and horizons for many. The best one can hope is that the stauch \"my way\" based \"solutions\" end up helping more than they hurt. Despite the last administration's budget surplus many still see the ballooning spending rates in healthcare, the rising welfare spending and so on as a growing concern along with economic volatility creating uncertainty in the dollar's value itself. If congress can't get the deficit spending under control there may be turbulent times ahead. Alas only time and congress shall be able to tell that."

However the Department of the Interior has a job to do and for the msot part they do actually do it, to the dislike of many. Now as a new millennia is upon us the department must find new ways to balance social developments and land preservation in this ever changing world."

 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_general_staff_desc: "Ever since the Cold War ended the American general staff apparatus has had to adapt to a more peace time oriented environment. As a result more and more red tape and cumbersome bureaucracy measures have begun to take over aspects of the procurement and R&D sectors. As a result and the continued peace a slow but growing problem of recruitment and logistical cohesion when conducting something as simple as maintaining barracks and other housing structures for the troops has begun to take hold. Regardless the US general staff is one of the most proficient in its field and that field is war itself, so despite it's short comings, it's still got some kick in it."

While the US navy is the largest navy in the world in terms of tonnage the navy is also the biggest advantage the US has in terms of exerting its soft power throughout the world. So while the air force and army fight it over the budgeting amounts each fiscal period, many can't argue against the importance the US navy has in securing the current position the United States has in the globe."
 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_airforce: "United States Air Force"
 USA_dynamic_modifier_us_airforce_desc: "The US air force is the R&D special child. Being so advanced at points that R&D is now seen as more of a hobby at times rather than a true need for defence, regardless with most of the world still struggling against aircraft developed 40 nearly 50+ years ago it's no wonder that the US air force is one of the most feared entities out there.

 USA_american_tax_code: "American Tax Code"
 USA_american_tax_code_desc: "The tax code of the United States is one which is both hated and loathed by many. With the same energy in the same sentence, politicians have brought about and taken away change which has not only affected millions of Americans but also few Americans as well. The modern discontent with the Internal Revenue Service and the overall makeup of the tax code itself has been a very sensitive subject for the average American. But with the new Millennia comes new bills, and new bills mean new changes...the only hope is that those changes are good, rather than worse."

As anti-war sentiment grew and the cultural and social revolutions of the time became more and more prominent many looked to the television and more specifically to the news for their information. With this came two eventual camps of thought. Traditionalist thinking where the news was supposed to be strictly non-politically oriented when addressing topics of the day, and then there were the activist camp. Modern thinking where the news through opinion pieces could be used to get the word out on issues that mattered, to spread awareness and so forth. While the activist camp seems to have won in the long run the fears of the traditionalist have started to come true as signs of political entrenchment have started becoming apparent."

 USA_migrant_crisis_one_desc: "Since around 2013 a shocking uptick in illegal immigration into the US has been on the rise. Now most wouldn't really acknowledge this unless they lived on the border states, however the reality is much worse than that. Statistics have shown a stark rise in children and women fatalities in relation to immigration as well as crimes related to human trafficking and other grossly illegal acts towards these refugees and migrants. We'll need to start dedicating actual resources to this situation, however we'll need to figure out a real solution if we are to genuinely resolve this now official crisis."
 USA_migrant_crisis_two: "Southern Migrant Crisis Stagnation"
 USA_migrant_crisis_two_desc: "The recent failure of the federal government to win Texas v United States over the expansion of DACA and DAPA has resulted in mostly inaction over the current migrant crisis at the southern border. This divide between state and federal views on how to handle the crisis as well as the near constant congressional deadlock over this hot button issue has resulted in an increasing trend of migrants coming over. Will congress be able to figure this out?"
 USA_migrant_crisis_two_a: "Southern Migrant Crisis De-Escalation"
 USA_migrant_crisis_two_a_desc: "With the federal victory in the recent Texas v United States, federal funding and increased USBP agent counts have seen a reduction in over all illegal border crossings. However whether this is truly a success or a failure will only be determined by time itself. As many border states have become more disheartened by the federal government essentially signing their states away to become refugee camps. Though many away from the border see this as a gross exaggeration, no one is truly certain what is and isn't the case at this time."
 USA_migrant_crisis_three: "Southern Migrant Problem"

 USA_migrant_crisis_three_a: "Southern Migrant Indecision"
 USA_migrant_crisis_three_a_desc: "The recent contesting of the members within the supreme court in relation to the asylum denial ruling has sparked the immigration debate again. However this deflating of some kind of action has resulted in yet more nothing being done, about immigration or its tidal wave of knock on effects and influences it has throughout the US economy."
 USA_migrant_crisis_four: "A Growing Problem"
 USA_migrant_crisis_four_desc: "The Southern Border Problem is one which stretches back to in some cases 2013. Where a shocking rise in unattended minors were encountered at the border. Rising crime rates related to human trafficking and other severe crimes were also seen on the rise due to the slow out stretching of resources being allocated to handle both normal traffic flow as well as immigration patterns both legal and illegal. From 2021-2024 a series of economic, social and natural disasters would hit a handful of central American nations resulting in what some hyperbolize as a \"monsoon\" of immigrants. However to many the problem doesn't solely fall on just the immigration, but on a series of out dated as well as counter intuative economic and social policies which have grown to decay under the quagmire of federal politics and political theater. In the end of it all, a problem is only a problem if you choose not to solve it or if you decide to make it one in the first place. So in that case, where or what is the real problem then."
 USA_migrant_crisis_five: "What's The Problem Exactly?"
 USA_migrant_crisis_five_desc: "After years of troubling news along the southern border, an artificial boost of traffic and migration due to events in Central America and finally action and reaction over the Southern Border \"problem\". Now nothing...nothing in the fact of concrete action, nothing in that the problem people focused on was not actually the real problem, just...nothing. For America has never had an earnest immigration problem in the modern age as America does not have a domestically growing population. But, I hear you say, America's population grows year after year. Ah yes it does, but how many immigrants did the US see in that exact same time period, huh. Now tell me what the real problem is, immigration, or allocation of resources, be they monetary, material or manpower."

But while stability and order is kept in the nation there is the wonder if such illusions are cause of truth, or complicity and apathy for change.

 usa.63.d: "With communists in power, it is time to consider changing some of the reminders of American Imperalism. A state and our great capital are named for a piece of slave-owning imperialistic scum. But there is a solution; Exchange the founder and first leader of the fake American capitalistic state with the patron saint of the American Communist Party. Gus Hall who passed away recently. The name is quite clearly a wonderful choice for a city name! Furthermore, there are tons of other cities and states which could use a renaming. North Carolina could become Vladimir after Lenin. There is so many possibilites and only fifty states!"

We can balance through a sort of \"American Legion\", where we'd involve ourselves through sending advisors and equipment and so forth.

Finally a third main group wants to fully decentralize the network and let the private sector take over.

 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t: "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1: "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."

 donald_trump.9.t: "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d: "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1: "Let's get that baby into orbit"

 donald_trump.10.t: "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d: "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1: "Mining shall begin"

 donald_trump.11.t: "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d: "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jealousy looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1: "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.12.t: "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d: "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1: "Excellent!"

 donald_trump.13.t: "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d: "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 donald_trump.13.o1: "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.o2: "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 #Mission To Mars Event Chain

 #Some events are out of order for the event number, but in order for the chain both in the code and order it appears
 donald_trump.23.t: "Mission to Mars"
 donald_trump.23.d: "Mr. President, with funding secured, and plans complete, we can now prepare a group of men and women to withstand the immense pressure and loneliness in space in order to reach Mars.\n\nLuckily, NASA has already been preparing for such a trip for years, it's just not had the funding to launch a full program. The additional training of current astronauts and preparation of the rocket will start in earnest.\n\nThis process will take roughly a year for it to complete. In the mean time, scientists at NASA laboratories are preparing scientific equipment to be sent along with the astronauts to Mars to collect useful scientific data that one cannot achieve with a rover. Do keep in mind, SpaceX may attempt to get a man there first upon hearing the announcement."
 donald_trump.23.o1: "Preparations shall begin"

 donald_trump.24.t: "Space Race"
 donald_trump.24.d: "In a recent news release, SpaceX has decided to launch its own program to get to Mars in under a year. Now, if SpaceX gets there first, it will still be an achievement that you can use for additional investment into space, however, it will be... let's just say... not as politically convinient.\n\nThis new Space Race for Mars will require additional investment if we are wanting to secure victory first, however, some experts argue that Elon Musk's program lacks certain aspects required to go to Mars with a crewed mission there and back. We may just be able to get to Mars first without assigning additional funds to NASA.\n\nWhat is your directive, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.24.o1: "Space Race it is!"
 donald_trump.24.o2: "Continue at the current pace"

 donald_trump.14.t: "Mission to Mars Ready"
 donald_trump.14.d: "NASA has just sent confirmation that the astronauts, equipment, and rocket are ready. There are six particular astronauts heading to Mars with a return journey. The astronauts heading to Mars are as follows: Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne. These astronauts have prepared over the past two years, and are the most fit astronauts for this mission. The rocket, NASA's recent Space Launch System, is ready to be launched. The capsule, the Orion Space Capsule, is also ready.\n\nFortunately, the next launch window is in 30 days."
 donald_trump.14.o1: "30 days until launch!"

 donald_trump.15.t: "On the Launch Pad"
 donald_trump.15.d: "[GetDateText]:\nOur six astronauts are ready. It will be a long difficult journey, but they are prepared for it. Paul seems especially excited about the prospect, while the rest of the crew is nervous, particularly Rodney, albeit willing.\n\nThe Astronauts are in the rocket, ready to blast off into Space. They gave their farewells to family and friends, for they will not see them in person for nearly two years. All are optimistic for a successful mission.\n\nThe countdown has begun, with the launch confirmed."
 donald_trump.15.o1: "3, 2, 1..."

 donald_trump.16.t: "Lift Off!"
 donald_trump.16.d: "Launch Control has certified liftoff, and the rocket and crew are heading to Mars! People's heads are towards the sky, as the rocket heading for orbit. Its crew are both ecstatic and relieved, as it's a perfect launch. Everything has worked so far, and there is much hope that it will continue to work for months to come.\n\nThe dream is near complete."
 donald_trump.16.o1: "An exciting day in history"

 donald_trump.17.t: "Disaster Strikes!"
 donald_trump.17.d: "The rocket has exploded!\n\nIt turns out that the essential final checks were inadequate to stop a catastrophe. It has been reported that all six crew members, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne, have died in this calamity. The spectators on the ground are watching in disbelief as flames engulf the launch pad. It will much weaken the will for space in the coming future, and will be a stain on your presidency."
 donald_trump.17.o1: "A fatal accident"

 donald_trump.18.t: "Insanity in Space"
 donald_trump.18.d: "It turns out that prolonged periods in isolation with only five others to talk to are not suitable at all for the human psyche.\n\nDespite going through severe training before-hand, one astronaut, Michael, went mentally insane and attempted to manually control the craft to return to Earth as soon as possible. Anne, the only other person awake at the time, attempted to get in his way and halt him, however, she was unable to wrestle him away from the controls. While she was attempting to do this, Michael punched Anne in the jaw, knocking her unconcious.\n\nFortunately, the other crew members were wakened by the disorder, and immediately jumped to aid Anne. A quick struggle ensued where the control panel was slightly dented, however, everything remains operational and Michael is now in a makeshift prison with makeshift handcuffs. Additional good news, Anne was not permanently injured, and will be able to recover within a week on the vessel. Whether she has long term damage would have to be investigated by doctors at home.\n\nThe bad news is that the rocket is widely off-course. Additionally, a lot of fuel was burned in Michael's hasty attempt to return to Earth.\n\nThere are two options: Return to Earth with all the astronauts, arresting Michael for assualt and endangering five other lives, or send them on a one way trip to Mars. The five astronauts have expressed that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of humanity.\n\nMr. President. What is your choice?"
 donald_trump.18.o1: "If the remaining astronauts are ready for it, then let them go"
 donald_trump.18.o2: "Let's get our men and women home, and arrest that son of a bitch"

 donald_trump.19.t: "Shamed Return"
 donald_trump.19.d: "Months ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts onboard to return to Earth to avoid a one-way trip. Anne has been sent to the hospital to investigate if she has injuries undiscovered by the crew, and Michael has been arrested and will likely be sent to a mental hospital. The other astronauts, other than Mary, have offered their services again to space, while Mary has decided to retire from her astronaut career early. They are all happy to be home alive.\n\nThis is likely the end to any government program to send humans to Mars for quite a long time to come."
 donald_trump.19.o1: "Unfortunate, but at least they're alive"

 donald_trump.20.t: "Sacrifice on Mars"
 donald_trump.20.d: "Weeks ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts to make the difficult decision to commit to a one-way trip to Mars. They have landed and have explored the Martian surface. They only have so long to live, so they intend to make the most of it. Significant research opportunities will result from this, however, it comes at a cost of human life.

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain

 donald_trump.26.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 donald_trump.26.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 donald_trump.26.o1: "Launch!"

 donald_trump.27.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 donald_trump.27.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 donald_trump.27.o1: "Science!"

 donald_trump.28.t: "Colony Progresses"
 donald_trump.28.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 donald_trump.28.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

 donald_trump.29.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.29.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 donald_trump.29.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.29.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 donald_trump.30.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 donald_trump.30.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 donald_trump.30.o1: "Life continues on"

 donald_trump.31.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.31.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 donald_trump.31.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.31.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

 donald_trump.32.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 donald_trump.32.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."

 donald_trump.500.d: "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"

One particular favorite, SpaceX, was pointed out directly in his speech on the AMI, stating \"Smart people, and boy, do we have some smart people, like my good friend at SpaceX, Elon Musk, will be able to send their space mining equipment to the asteroid, mine it, and sell it for profit.

A relatively slow asteroid, it was pulled into an elliptical orbit with Earth. Mining operations started as soon as it was in orbit. This news has been a surpise to the world, as it has been done far faster than expected. Many countries are now seeking to start their own asteroid mining programs to counteract the American monopoly. The United States does claim the entire asteroid.

While many believe this to be a good thing for the NFP, some of the hardliners are cautious due to the supposed balance the coalition was to have."
 USA_reformed_republic.100.o1: "Why Ruin A Good Thing?"
 USA_reformed_republic.101.t: "Party Base Shifts"
 USA_reformed_republic.101.d: "Rising concerns by hardliners within the NFP have started voicing the fact that a notable shift in the party base has begun. The military has seen rising volunteer numbers as well as national and state guard units have seen more towards raising the praises of the Pentagon elite then they have of the national leaders. Most of the voting base however has been seen as dismissing these concerns as in the words of one member quote, We all want a strong military and so who cares, end quote. Nevertheless the hardliners have become nervous over the shifting tides of the party."
 USA_reformed_republic.101.o1: "Lets Address These Concerns."

 ##American Fascist Events
 USA_reformed_republic.200.t: "Public Naturalism Grows"
 USA_reformed_republic.200.d: "Fascist as well as their hardliner friends in the ANP and KKK have been in a state of glee as recent national trends show a growing demand of the US becoming more in line with its naturalistic history. A rise in attacks against ethnic minorities and essentially anyone who does not fit the supposed \"American\" identity. This essentially boils down to a Western European identity as the olive skinned peoples of the Southwestern parts of Europe were seen as products of their times. Many in the military are indifferent but a lot of moderates within the NFP are seeing concerns of a potential party shift as public trends seem to begin favoring one of the major factional groups within the NFP."
 USA_reformed_republic.200.o1: "An American Nation For An American People."
 USA_reformed_republic.201.t: "Moderates Seek Asylum"
 USA_reformed_republic.201.d: "National news breaks as cowardly fence sitters and seditionist flee the nation. The new party head of the NFP has seen fit to declare that quote, \"The enemies of the state as well as their feeble ideals flee our great nation. Today marks a real turning point in America's history as we the people now have the true rule.\" The speech went on for roughly a total of three hours as radios and television stations alike were lit up broadcasting this speech to all who would watch or listen. Global leaders are wary of the new American government and talks have already begun of what America's status should be with it no longer being the beacon of Democracy."
 USA_reformed_republic.201.o1: "Pax Americana Has Ended?"

 ##American Monarchist Events
 USA_reformed_republic.300.t: "Modern Monarchism?"
 USA_reformed_republic.300.d: "Monarchism, a term used to describe the old era of nearly a century ago. Yet through apparently strength of will a new movement has lead the forefront of the NFP. The \"Modern Monarchist Movement\", is a faction that wishes to breath a modern light onto an old ideal. Through countless of rallies, speeches, informational pamphlets and so on the MMM have made clear that the modern system will not change, but rather be cosmetically altered. Many are skeptical of this new group but with the slogan, \"Every Man A King, Every Woman A Queen\", some do like the idea of making that little childhood fantasyy into a modern reality."
 USA_reformed_republic.300.o1: "What Fantasy Show Will This Be?"
 USA_reformed_republic.301.t: "Fantasy, More Like Reality"
 USA_reformed_republic.301.d: "In a shocking turn of events the MMM has secured majority power within the NFP, with radicals in the naturalist camp leaving the party and finding isolation in the wilds and forests of the expanse of continental America. The military is easier to convince due to the historic implications that monarchies have always prided their military. As for the fence sitters, well they're still sitting, enjoying the peace and understanding that things are not getting worse so its only up from here. The MMM has begun making swift moves to inform the public as well as the greater world to ensure a peaceful rise and understanding of what many fear is the fall of the American Eagle."
 USA_reformed_republic.301.o1: "Does The Eagle Get Another Head Now?"

 ##Commissariat Coup Events
 USA_reformed_republic.400.t: "The Commissariat Corps"
 USA_reformed_republic.400.d: "The Commissariat Corps is the military political wing of the Red Army. This group has seen more volunteers and interest in understanding the way to properly militarize the nation in line with the Socialist principles which will free our nation from the old order. Recently though the national committee has had some concerns over the growing ranks and popularity of the Commissariat Corps, though CC leadership assures the committee that there are know plans to do anything drastic. This has not stopped rumors from spreading in the lower ranks of the Corps."
 USA_reformed_republic.400.o1: "Surely You Jest, Right?"
 USA_reformed_republic.401.t: "The Red Junta?"
 USA_reformed_republic.401.d: "In a shocking twist which looks like weeks of pre-meditated planning, a cabal of young officers in the Commissariat Corps have initiated a coup and established what they call the \"Red Junta\". This Socialist Military Junta seems to want to take the idea of national pride in service to the country and combine it with the ideas of Socialist economics. Given how both ideals can be used in an egalitarian and or unitarian sense many are surprisingly taken with the idea. But for now moderates and global spectators look on wondering what will this new faction will do."
 USA_reformed_republic.401.o1: "A Red Junta? What Nonsense, It Won't Last!"

 ## American Trotskyist Events
 USA_reformed_republic.500.t: "The Socialist Workers Party"
 USA_reformed_republic.500.d: "In recent weeks the rise of the SWP has seen some heads turn in both intruige and disgust. Most see the pro-trotskyist party as a stain on real socialist principles, while others see them as mear idealist who want nothing but power. Nevertheless some concern has arose as more people seem to be joining the ranks of the SWP and it is threatening to tip the balances of power within the coalition. Party leadership is looking to cull any excesses to the SWP's influences but many are unsure if it will help."
 USA_reformed_republic.500.o1: "The Global Revolution...Suffering More Like It."
 USA_reformed_republic.501.t: "Ruthless Coup!"
 USA_reformed_republic.501.d: "In a shocking turn of events, organizers from the SWP have seized power and slaughtered key coalition leaders. The SWP leadership has proclaimed quote, \"We the members of the Socialist Workers Party have done the nation a favor. For it is time that we stop playing games and understand the true goals and ideals that Socialism and Socialist want. Unity, not compromise is the future and we will ensure that future is a reality. For The Socialist Dream!!!\". Many have begun to flee the nation and some nations around the world are already looking to impose sanction on the United States of America and wonder what the future truly entails. For now many are worried and buying time to defend from potential incursions."
 USA_reformed_republic.501.o1: "Dear God, What Have We Done."

 ## American Anarchist Society Events
 USA_reformed_republic.600.t: "The American Anarchist Society"
 USA_reformed_republic.600.d: "The AAS or American Anarchist Society is a fringe and clearly out of date political entity. Supposedly under the assumption that Anarchism can suvive in such a civilized world, they tout their pamphlets and make speeches about the collective good and goals of the society. Well despite a slight trend in their membership and positions in the coalition, many discount them no more better than the quirks of the fringe."
 USA_reformed_republic.600.o1: "*scoffs* What Are We Apes?"
 USA_reformed_republic.601.t: "The Impossible Clearly Was Possible"
 USA_reformed_republic.601.d: "In a confusing and outlandish series of events, somehow the AAS has secured a majority within the coalition. Many onlookers both domestically and internationally stare in a mix of disbelief and confusion as the epitome of Oxymoronic actions have culminated in what is being proclaimed as the quote, \"First Elected Anarchist Government\". Nevertheless things appear to be moving on as normal but many still stare in an almost catatonic state at what is there to actually do now. But only time will tell if this is a ruse or something to be excited or dishearted by, only time can truly tell at this point."
 USA_reformed_republic.601.o1: "Surely This Is a Joke...Right..Right?"


 #Mini Crisis Event Chain 1
 USA_crisis_event.1.t: "Protest Movements Cause Panic"
 USA_crisis_event.1.d: "In recent days a crisis has arisen in the nation as a series of targeted protests has cause growing civil unrest as certain essential services like 911 and local emergency response forces have been obstructed. Several deaths which have transpire are being blamed on the protests due to the delays which emergency services have suffered. Some governors and even members of congress are drawing up plans to deal with the problem. Some recommend we let the problem be dealt locally, others recommend mobilizing federal agencies, while some still even recommend just let it play out as it'll snuff itself out.

 USA_crisis_event.2.t: "Local Situation Deteriorates"
 USA_crisis_event.2.d: "Federal inaction has been spun by local leaders and by some national news outlets as weak and indirectly negotiating with what is turning into a domestic terror situation. State officials now are petitioning the president to intervene using federal assets, while some still believe the problem should pass and we'll look like dictators if we respond.

 USA_crisis_event.2.o2: "Cautious Action For A Cautious Order"
 USA_crisis_event.3.t: "A Wavering Light"
 USA_crisis_event.3.d: "The inaction of the federal government is starting to run thin on a lot of people's nerves. More now even locally are wanting the president to intervene to restore order as local officials appear to not be convicted enough to make decisive actions. Though it looks like there maybe a break in the intensity, it could backfire as public trust has already sunken to a new low. The Choice is now, take a chance of peaceful resolution, or secure the region and bring back order and stability...whatever is left that is."

 USA_crisis_event.500.o1: "Peace In Our Time"



 #Mini Crisis Event Chain 2
 USA_crisis_event.4.t: "Congress Does It Again"
 USA_crisis_event.4.d: "Shocking news has come out of congress that the fiscal appropriations bill has not been resolved and is being deadlocked by members tacking on addendums and additives to the overall legislation. We've had these scares before, let alone the last real government shutdown was back in 95, so there shouldn't be to much to worry about."
 USA_crisis_event.4.o1: "Can't We Just Get Along?!?"
 USA_crisis_event.5.t: "Congress Deadlocking Looms Shutdown"
 USA_crisis_event.5.d: "With talks growing ever more stubborn we've since seen that a government shutdown is upon us. Both sides seem overtly adament about what they expect in this fiscal years' appropriations bill and as such we could cost ourselves the coming election if things persist. The president is scrambling advisors and capitol hill is buzzing with congressional members trying to seek out as much political power they may have left."
 USA_crisis_event.5.o1: "What The Hell Is Going On!?!"
 USA_crisis_event.5.o2: "Focus On The Election"
 USA_crisis_event.6.t: "Stock Market Causes Panic"
 USA_crisis_event.6.d: "With the shutdown turning into the longest to date, 20 days as of this report. Many are beginning to fear the economic ramifications as federal programs have essentially grown into a redundant state. Wall Street has seen a slow drop in the DOW and S&P 500 respectively as even the supposed lobbyist are gobsmacked at these recent turn of events. All eyes are on the administration to see if things will recover or only get worse."
 USA_crisis_event.6.o1: "Can't We Get Anyone To Agree!!!"
 USA_crisis_event.6.o2: "Call A Press Conference NOW!!"
 USA_crisis_event.7.t: "Looming Panic Grips Nation"
 USA_crisis_event.7.d: "The shutdown has lasted over two whole months. Panic on Wall Street has sent a shock to the investing arm of our economy. Rumors have it that several regional banks are nearing bankruptcy and that union agitation against the railroads has rapidly increased. If the situaion continues to decline who knows what will become of the very home we live in."
 USA_crisis_event.7.o1: "§RTHEY'VE DONE WHAT!!!§!"
 USA_crisis_event.7.o2: "§GLiquidate The Situation, Screw The Election§!"
 USA_crisis_event.600.t: "Back To Normal..."
 USA_crisis_event.600.d: "It would appear as things have begun to calm down. With the drastic shift in the president's priorities and with what many likely would see as strong arming. Congress has finally found a way to pass the legally required appropriations bill to continue normal government functions. Whether for better or worse it does look like things are back to a somewhat level state. For now the quote, Eternal Shutdown, has come to an end, lets just hope we don't repeat this...please."

 USA_collapse_event.1.d: "With the Class 1's neglecting their duties and the federal government seen as weak to the strikers. Talks of an impending railroad strike are buzzing about.

 USA_collapse_event.1.o1: "Can We Fix This?!?"
 USA_collapse_event.2.t: "Congress Proposes Deal"
 USA_collapse_event.2.d: "The scramble for a fair deal to avoid the strike has come with a heavy heart. Strikers and the Class 1's which are being affected are at a stand still. A major problem being argued constantly is the points system used to regulate how employees take days off whether sick or not. This gross umbrella-ing of how to keep employees at work and efficient in their jobs has resulted in a strong animosity. This tension has now come to head and congress has hit a road block with the reality of the situation becoming a growing fear for DC as a whole."
 USA_collapse_event.2.o1: "Surely They Will See Reason...Right?"
 USA_collapse_event.3.t: "The Negotiations Fall Through"
 USA_collapse_event.3.d: "Negotiations have exploded in on themselves as panic on Wall Street has seen a recession like fall in the stock market. The impact of the strikes has seen several governors declare a state of emergency to try and quell ever rising public disorder.

However in harder hit areas opportunists have taken this same government intervention and stirred the pot too much. Civilian casualties have begun to be reported and droves of refugees have begun to leave the nation. Rumors along with the media's ever so hyperbolic mantra has only made the issue worse with ever growing amounts of reports of mass rioting and looting consuming the entire nation. This snowballing trend has resulted in ever growing amount of property damage and destruction of infrastructure as a whole.

However loyalist military personnel have taken up defensive posturing in what is now being called the Federalist states. Governors and local officials around the country are scrambling to get ahold of their own backyards. Mass migration of US citizens have been recorded and Canada along with Mexico have had to step up asylum camps and general containment grounds to prevent this archaic spill over from destroying their countries as well."

Using a recent call of identity known as Cascadia, said Cascadians have begun to organize their own military force using remnants of the national guard and federal facilities in their states as a sort of canvas.

The plantiffs in this case have sued the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, asking the court to halt implementation of both the DACA expansion and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA). The case was considered by judge Andrew S. Hanen who issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, Texas v. United States, proceeded."

While many say we are flooding the country, others point out we have a moral obligation to properly process and at the very least care for those who made the long and extremely dangerous trip. As this \"debate\" rages on a lot more people who are not really active in terms of the news cycle realize the growing issue our federal government has become. With some saying its purely D.C.'s fault for this issue, while others say its the fault of older generations for not thinking ahead. Younger generations are starting to slowly become more politically active as the American Dream begins to turn into the American Make Believe, with many siting inconsistent and outright decaying reforms and regulations which have left younger generations in the dust in terms of economic mobility and opportunity. The question is whether this new youth movement will be able to gain enough traction to do something or not."

On one hand you have Hillary Clinton, a veteran politician with a wealth of experience at the federal level as well as foreign policy. A strong and committed Democrat. To her left is Senator Bernie Sanders another veteran politician that is very charismatic despite his age, Senator Sanders has been a very strong leader for the Progressive movement in America, despite what opposition leaders may have you believe he is a \"Socialist\", the reality is, he's more of a mix of center-left and the standard Demsoc you might find in Europe, at least when looking through the perspective of American social and econmic policies that is. Finally to the right hand side of both we have Donald Trump, businessman, novice and changing political interest as Trump has been a registered Democrat, Republican and even at one point joined Ross Perot's Reform Party back during his election bid for president. Trump is seen as a half breed between Evangelical and center-right, with inconsistent policy positions throughout the right spectrum as well as a supposed \"pro-America\" policy in relation to taxes and business incentivizing. In the end this cross roads will determine if and when America could see a major shift. For now lets just see who wins."

The ruling was stated to take effect in the first week of October, however protest against the ruling as inhumane has resulted in a renewal of the immigration debate. The administration has stated that this ruling does a strong blow to false asylum seekers which are inhibiting real asylum seekers from getting the care and attention they need.

Currently as of January 22nd Texas National Guard units and federal BP agents are at a stand off, with a continued tit for tat over the setting up and destroying of razer wire similar to what you would see on a military outpost defensive fence line. For now many both locally and nationally hold their breath and some even openly send support for Texas as events proceed to play out.

 USA_crisis_event.1107.d: "Back in January Texas forces had a stand off with federal forces at Eagle Pass at a place called Shelby Park. Federal forces withdrew and continued the tit for tat tactics related to the more aggressive defensive \"fortifications\" they were putting along the border. However a statement has come out directly from the federal government which had detailed that Texas forces should stand down and let the federal government do its contitutional and legal job of maintaining the national border in the south along its Mexican neighbor. This statement was left unanswered and things had seemed to quiet down, however ealier today an official statement was released by the governor of Texas stating that quote, \"The federal government has failed in its constitutional and legal duties to protect and maintain the security of the national border. As such I and as well as all of Texas and her local law and military forces will do whatever is needed to at the very least protect our own borders.\" Several states have already sent aid and manpower to the state of Texas in the force of volunteer law enforcement personnel and national guard soldiers with estimates of up to 500 national guard soldiers being sent by several other states who supported the actions of Texas in the on going crisis. This more or less hostile approach has many worried that America is on the brink of a constitutional crisis as both sides begin to take shape over whether or not Texas or the federal government is truly at fault."

Many fear that Texas is on the cusp of doing something drastic and the federal government is looking to find ways to handle the situation without overt aggression. As one insider source states, \"People know Texas is technically in the wrong, but we've reach the national level of involvement and in general no one has been happy with the federal government on either side. So we need to do whatever possible to ensure that we can openly and quickly prove we are not the bad guys by how we treat the situation.\" Many hardliners see this as spineless, however moderates and even some opposition viewers have stated their open support and surprise at the handling of the federal government."

 USA_crisis_event.1109.d: "In the following months congress was put back into session and even an emergency session as well. However it was during the start of July's emergency session which resulted in a shock to the nation. As it was reported no representatives both House and Senate had showed up from the state of Texas. Soon news reporters were swarming the Texas governors office about the situation in which he held a press conference over the situation. At the press conference all absent members had shown up and pledged their protest in union with one another of the federal government's over stepping boundaries and pure negligence. For not just Texas but to the border states and some may even say the general states of this very union we call ourselves. Soon after the declaration of protest the governor ended the press conference to a flurry of pleas and questions from the crowd of new reporters as now the protest and Texas's now open defiance against the federal government was broadcast to the nation. A response from the federal administration stated that quote, \"This is an outright challenge to the authority and duties of the federal government. More so it is a challenge to the union for which we have had since 1865 when we solidified and reintegrated the confederate states back into the union and came to the unified understanding of the meaning and principles of our very existence as a nation.\" Though many were inspired by these words, some were worried it may only cause other states to side with Texas if they felt disconnected or left behind by the federal government.

Fears have struck a fever pitch as never before has a hard border been established within the United States before, even with the Civil War open rebellion was first followed by the \"established border of the south\". It is with this notion that the federal government has issued an ultimatum to the state of Texas and its government. It reads, \"Cease all establishment of a hard border within these United States or the state of Texas will be declared in open rebellion and placed under marshal law until the rebellion is under control.\" This declaration comes at a horrible time as its only been a year into the new presidency as well as things are nearing the holidays. Many are afraid of a war in their own backyard as rumors are abound of state governments weighing their options and wondering just what will the federal government do to the citizens of Texas and technically their own citizens by proxy. For now everyone waits with baited breath as Texas and the federal government look to be gearing up for a standoff."

Rumors and fears are rampant of more potentially leaving the union as well as desertions and mutinies within the army as many genuinely don't want to turn their guns on fellow Americans despite if they agree with them or not. This ungodly moralism has lead to a slight fit of lock up in military cohesion and actions as orders are getting lost and troops are not always cooperating with officers.

The meeting itself started off a little heated as some border representatives were just tired of the political pressure caused by the overt increase in traffic flow around their states as there is no increase in resources to account and tend to such increases. However neutral controlling parties tempered these outbursts before they could escalate. After a generally lengthy debate and back and forth a general aggreement was reached. Budgetary increases to improve processing facilities, recruit more personnel and set a plan for a genuine border line to help monitor and look out for migrants looking to enter the US regardless of legal or illegal intent to limit excesses in oversight will be implemented as soon as possible. Consequently plans will be drafted by the USBP agency and congress with local state governments to create new border crossing facilities to allow for better disemmination of traffic to and from the US and Mexico as well as better spread out immigration processing as well. Many see this as a win for the nation as a whole as political and independent activists were able to create enough pressure against not only state but federal officials to cause genuine change related to a political manner. In the following days more and more organized political movements would cause pressures for political and ecdonomic reforms which have many more debating on the validity of the current two party system."
