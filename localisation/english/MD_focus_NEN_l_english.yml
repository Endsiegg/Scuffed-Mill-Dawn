NEN_focus_maine_mayhem: "Maine Mayhem"
NEN_focus_maine_mayhem_desc: "With Maine being our largest state by landmass, it is also the hardest to wrangle as people try to hide in the forests and mountains. We must therefore draw them out through the creation of a basic economic structure. Food is a right for us to survive and live and Maine will serve as a good starting grounds for such a basic economic makeup."
NEN_focus_greenville_gallantries: "Greenville Gallantries"
NEN_focus_greenville_gallantries_desc: "As the people begin to work together and societal cohesion molding into a peaceful form, now is the time we begin to implement administrative and civil services. Soon enough the state of Maine will be a marvel to embrace in our young nation."
NEN_focus_hampshire_havoc: "New Hampshire Havoc"
NEN_focus_hampshire_havoc_desc: "Being roughly the central most state of our new nation, New Hampshire is a strategically important state to restore order to our nation at large. Therefore we must establish infrastructure and economic activity to prepare the state for \"reintegration\"."
NEN_focus_concord_concrete: "Concord Concrete"
NEN_focus_concord_concrete_desc: "Economic and social cohesion has reach acceptable levels where we can begin rolling out the implementation of civil and emergency services to better the people's lives and restore law and order to the state. Within all this the main economic power has been the construction company known as Concord Concrete, where they literally have been laying the foundations for the future of our young nation."
NEN_focus_messychusetts: "Messychusetts"
NEN_focus_messychusetts_desc: "Massachusetts has turned into an outright mess since the fall of the old republic. This is devestating to our young nation as many within our nation consider Boston itself to be the cultural capital which broadly identifies what it means to be a New Englander. As such we will do what we can to clean up, rebuild and set forth a path to bringing back this culture into the spotlight."
NEN_focus_boston_beauty: "Boston Beauty"
NEN_focus_boston_beauty_desc: "Through tireless work and sweat of brow we now restore the glory of this once beautiful city and land.

NEN_focus_vermont_violence: "Vermont Violence"
NEN_focus_vermont_violence_desc: "Vermont, the other half of the \"Triangle Twins\", is a state on the border with New York and with this is also pretty isolated despite its development. With this isolation, rampant acts of violence has consumed the streets and it is our job to restore peace and stability to the state so it can be brought back into its Northeastern family. We'll start with some limited economic and basic infrastructure investments along the Massachusetts and New Hampshire border regions and go from there."
NEN_focus_virtuous_vermont: "Virtuous Vermont"
NEN_focus_virtuous_vermont_desc: "It took some time, but with hard work and commendable amounts of dedication from the local population we have started to return peace and virtue to these once unstable lands. Now we can establish governmental administration and law enforcement to better organize and set up the basis of reintegration of the state."
NEN_focus_connecticut_crutch: "The Connecticut Crutch"
NEN_focus_connecticut_crutch_desc: "Our second smallest state, yet one which encompasses about a third of our coastline, Connecticut serves has a bit of a gamble in its own right. It's economic diversity is hard to amintain with so much coastline and not much inland terrain to work with. As such it is our responsibility to set forth a standard of diversity in terms of economics so the state and it's people have just as much opportunities as any other part of our nation."
NEN_focus_middletown_miracle: "Middletown Miracle"
NEN_focus_middletown_miracle_desc: "With some light investment in agriculture and food processing industries we have been able to set a baseline that isn't just \"heavy manufacturing or shipping\". Now we can begin to implement civil services and re-establish order and peace to the state, making it one more piece in the New England puzzle."
NEN_focus_rhode_island_riots: "Rhode Island Riots"
NEN_focus_rhode_island_riots_desc: "Despite being our smallest territory, the state of Rhode Island has been taken over by roaming gangs of rioters. With such instability we'll need to set up essentially only border settlements to disuade the rioters from continuing. From there we can slowly roll in law enforcement agencies to allow for the chipping away at this \"organized chaos\"."
NEN_focus_providence_parties: "Providence Parties"
NEN_focus_providence_parties_desc: "It took some time, but we finally did it. The groups of rioters have shrunken considerably and social cohesion has begun to take priority among the peoples of the state. With this ever growing trend of stability it is now time to capitalize on it by ushering in civil services like local law enforcement, fire and governmental administration. Soon enough our nation will be whole once more."
NEN_focus_new_new_england: "New, New England"
NEN_focus_new_new_england_desc: "It has been a long and dangerous journey, but with dedication, determination and the will of the peoples of our great nation we have prevailed. Our nation is united and with this unity we set forth a path for which we can create. The future is now and the future will be ours to have."

NEN_event.1.t: "Seat Of Government"
NEN_event.1.d: "With our new nation rising up from the old republic we must look to establishing our nation's capital. Many just wish to make things simple so we can get on with our days and work towards stabilizing the realm. As such a debate on which state capital will seat the national capital is raging on. So far our choices seem to be Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Whatever the choice will be will likely be a good one regardless since all are relatively close to one another."

NEN_event.2.t: "Capital Choice"
