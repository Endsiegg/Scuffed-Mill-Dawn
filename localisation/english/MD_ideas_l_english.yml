While the exact extent to which the policy has put a brake on population growth is disputed, the substantial effects of the policy on Chinese society are undeniable."
 factional_politics_balanced: "Factional Politics - Balanced"
 factional_politics_balanced_desc: "The power struggle between populists who hail from the rural provinces and elitists from the more urban, built-up areas of China has died down and members of both sides agree that compromise is the best way forward to secure China’s future."
 factional_politics_populist: "Factional Politics - Youth League Dominance"
 factional_politics_populist_desc: "Advocates of populist policies, such as alumni of the Communist Youth League, currently determine Chinese national policy. This challenges established interests in favour of the rural poor, but does not favour economic growth."
 factional_politics_elitist: "Factional Politics - Shanghai Clique Dominance"
 factional_politics_elitist_desc: "Members of the more pro-business, pro-development faction of Chinese politics hold the reins of power. This helps growth and development but makes it more difficult to win support among the rural poor and to fight corruption."
 three_represents: "Three Represents"
 three_represents_desc: "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin. The theory states that the Communist Party must be representative of advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the majority. The implications of this theory are a greater acceptance by the Communist Party of China’s growing business class, leading it to be criticized in some areas for departing from Marxism and Mao Zedong thought."
 scientific_outlook_on_development: "Scientific Outlook on Development"
 scientific_outlook_on_development_desc: "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."
 zeng_qinghong_thought: "Zeng Qinghong Thought"
 zeng_qinghong_thought_desc: "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people. Key to this theory is the idea of the “gaze of the people” and how party officials can only maximize the interests of the country when working under this gaze."
 xi_jinping_thought: "Xi Jinping Thought"
 xi_jinping_thought_desc: "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party and the country going forward. What sets this particular theory apart from those of most of Xi's predecessors is the extent to which adherance to this ideology is tied to loyalty. Loyalty to the party, loyalty to the country, but also significantly, loyalty to Xi Jinping himself."
 chongqing_model: "The Chongqing Model"
 chongqing_model_desc: "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including \"strike black\" and \"sing red\" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively. The model also represents a slight departure from China's market liberalization policies, with a strong emphasis on equitable distribution and state-owned enterprises."
 nanjie_model: "The Nanjie Model"
 nanjie_model_desc: "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
 open_nation: "Reformist Government"

 legacy_of_1949_desc: "The end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 saw the Nationalist Guomindang (GMD) and their supporters flee to the island province of Taiwan. The legacy of this event, combined with a local, nativist Taiwanese movement has led to a strong rejection of reunification with the mainland by the majority of Taiwanese citizens."

 Lacks_International_Recognition_Taiwan: "Lacks International Recognition"
 Lacks_International_Recognition_Taiwan_desc: "The ability of the Republic of China to conduct foreign policy is severely limited by its lack of international recognition, given that most states have chosen to recognize the People's Republic of China, its rival to the title of legitimate representative of the Chinese people. The ROC has sought to retain the loyalty of the few states that continue to recognize it, but it is fighting a losing battle. Two other paths lie before this country that is not a country - eventually reunify with the Chinese mainland, or go it alone and seek to be recognized not as the Republic of China, but as an independent Republic of Taiwan."

 South_China_Sea_Dispute_desc: "China's claims in the South China Sea overlap with those of many Southeast Asian nations. This overlap has led to substantial friction between China and countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent Malaysia. The stakes in this dispute are high due to the strategic location of islands like the Spratly and Paracel islands and the presence of oil in the region. The South China Sea issue has significantly hampered the improvement of relations between China and its rivals for control over the sea's many islands."

The US must either come to terms with this new world order and retreat into itself, or challenge China's newfound supremacy and maintain the US-centric world order. The latter can be brought about either by force or by supporting less revisionist political forces in China."

In the years following the end of the Cold War the new Russian Federation has sought to recover some of its former glory. Until recently Russia was aided in this goal by China, with the strategic partnership of both countries helping to undermine American hegemony. However China's great power aspirations have undermined Russia's position, as the Slavic giant has been forced out of its Central Asian sphere of influence by Chinese money. Russia must now either accept being a secondary power or seek to halt China's seemingly inexorable rise either by force or by supporting less revisionist political forces in China."

 #Hong Kong
 Basic_Law: "The Basic Law"
 Basic_Law_desc: "The Basic Law was the founding document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. Among other things, the document outlines the status of Hong Kong relative to China, granted it autonomy in all matters other than defence and foreign affairs, both of which are entrusted to the central government."
 One_Country_Two_Systems: "One Country Two Systems"
 One_Country_Two_Systems_desc: "Hong Kong has been guaranteed 50 years of autonomy from direct Chinese rule. The model of one country two systems allows for a preservation and indeed growth of many of Hong Kong's treasured political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of public assembly. The absence of these rights in the mainland is a significant driver behind support for the \"pan-democrat\" camp in Hong Kong politics, with many concerned Hongkongers remaining wary of greater integration with mainland China."
 Triads: "Triads"
 Triads_desc: "When the communists took power in China huge numbers of triad members fled to the British territory of Hong Kong for safety. In the following decades powerful triads such as the Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On and 14K triads have run protection rackets, gambling dens and other illicit activities. Despite their anti-communist roots, the triads have also started supporting Chinese interests in Hong Kong due to business connections on the mainland."
 Localist_Movement: "Localist Movement"
 Localist_Movement_desc: "Ever since the handover in 1997, tensions between mainland Chinese and Hongkongers have led to the development of localist \"Hong Kong First\" sentiment amongst some local Hongkongers. This sentiment views communist China's political system with distrust, but also views Hong Kong people as culturally distinct and indeed superior compared to the people of China. The rise of this movement from the 2014 Umbrella Movement onward has changed the previously more measured tone of the Hong Kong political divide into one that is more emotive and radical."
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage: "Lacks Universal Suffrage"
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "While the Basic Law calls for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council to eventually be elected by universal suffrage, this eventuality has yet to come to pass primarily due to China's concerns about what may happen if the significantly more popular pan-democrats take control of the government."
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage: "Limited Universal Suffrage"
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "China has agreed to allow the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be elected by universal suffrage, on the condition that candidates must be vetted by China first. This is widely seen as a move to reduce the likelihood of pan-democrat or localist candidates becoming Chief Executive."

These exercises are viewed by both nations as necessary defensive preparations in case of a North Korean invasion, but the North views them as a prelude to aggressive US-ROK action."
 NKO_nuclear_tests: "Nuclear Tests"
 NKO_nuclear_tests_desc: "Every few years the DPRK conducts nuclear weapons tests. This has drawn widespread condemnation by outside powers, including China despite its close relationship with North Korea. While North Korea maintains that its nuclear weapons program is defensive in nature, many fear the possibility that [NKO.GetLeader] could use the weapons on America or its allies."

 #International Recognition
 Non_State_Actor: "Non-State Actor"
 Non_State_Actor_desc: "Many international actors, from rebel groups to NGOs, possess international significance but are severly disadvantaged in a number of different ways by virtue of not being recognized states. Some of these non-state actors aspire to take control of an existing state by overthrowing an unjust government or to fashion a new one and redraw international borders. Others have no ambition for statehood, but instead use blunt force to accumulate power and wealth in local environments where the authority of the central government is absent."
 Lacks_International_Recognition: "Aspiring State"
 Lacks_International_Recognition_desc: "Some states possess everything you would normally associate with a state. A bureaucracy, a military, a national flag and so on. However, their statehood will never be complete without the added benefits conferred by the stamp of legitimacy of international recognition. These states may seek to acquire this recognition by campaigning for their cause overseas, with the eventual aim of winning the support of a critical mass of states in order to become full members of the international community."
 rival_government: "Rival Government"
 rival_government_desc: "Civil wars over control of the entire nation tend to produce two or more governments that claim to be the legitimate representatives of their people. This government is one that makes such a claim, but is disadvantaged by the fact that its status as legitimate representative is only recognized by a few other states, if any. It therefore does not represent its nation at international forums like the United Nations."

 #Myanmar/Burma

 ASEAN_Member: "ASEAN Member"
 ASEAN_Member_desc: "ASEAN is a primarily economic intergovernmental organisation based in Jakarta that was originally established in 1967. It has since expanded to include those countries that were originally excluded in the tense environment of the Cold War, and has sought to counter the growing influence of China as well as maintain independence from the West. It is committed to the principles of multilateralism, international law, peaceful dispute settlement, non-interference and self-determination."
 Rohingya_Crisis: "Rohingya Crisis"
 Rohingya_Crisis_desc: "Rakhine state has seen occasional outbursts of violence between Muslims describing themselves as “Rohingya” and local Rakhine Buddhists as well as the tatmadaw. The often brutal treatment of the Rohingya by the state of Myanmar has drawn strong condemnation from human rights organisations and Western countries, while Buddhist Nationalists in Rakhine state and elsewhere in Myanmar see the violence as a justified measure against illegal Bengali immigrants."
 Ethnic_Insurgencies: "Ethnic Insurgencies"
 Ethnic_Insurgencies_desc: "Since independence Myanmar has been engulfed by ethnic insurgencies in its remote, isolated border regions. Ethnic groups including the Karen, Kachin, Shan and many others see the central government as overwhelmingly Burman and Buddhist and so have taken up arms to preserve their unique ways of life."
 Democracy_Movement: "Democracy Movement"

 A_Political_Military: "A Political Military"
 A_Political_Military_desc: "Ever since the 1962 Burmese coup the Tatmadaw has been the dominant force in the politics of Myanmar. A disdain for civilian rule, democracy and freedom of speech on the one hand and a unified military culture shaped by decades of intense counterinsurgency warfare on the other have combined to produce a cohesive and politically active military.

 State_led_economy: "State-Led Economy"
 State_led_economy_desc: "While most of the world views liberal democracy and free-market capitalism as the necessary condition for economic development, the successful examples of South Korea, Taiwan and others points to the need for a strong, militaristic government to provide the foundations for growth."
 Buddhism_Official: "State Religion: Buddhism"
 Buddhism_Official_desc: "Having a state religion may appeal to some of the most devout Buddhists, but there is a reason for Burma going through most of its history without one. Having Buddhism as a state religion antagonizes those who subscribe to Christianity, Islam or one of Burma's many other religions. Having a state religion severely exacerbates tensions between the central government and the various often non-Buddhist ethnic rebel groups."
 ASEAN_Defence_Treaty: "ASEAN Mutual Defence Treaty"

 Chinese_Involvement: "Chinese Support"
 Chinese_Involvement_desc: "Despite being nominally supportive of Myanmar’s central government, China maintains a pragmatic attitude towards the conflict between government and rebels, maintaining close links to those rebel groups that control those regions of Myanmar that border Chinese territory. These links allow rebel groups to benefit from Chinese material assistance."
 Low_Chinese_Involvement: "Low-Level Chinese Support"
 Low_Chinese_Involvement_desc: "While only the United Wa State Army receives significant amounts of material assistance from the Chinese central government, many other rebel groups benefit from Chinese involvement in Myanmar more indirectly.

 Strategic_Capital: "Strategic Capital"
 Strategic_Capital_desc: "Yangon was deemed too vulnerable a capital for a security-conscious state like Myanmar to have.

 swiss_political_system_desc: "Switzerland has a very unique political system and is the only country in the world that can rightfully call itself a 'semi-direct democracy'. Citizens can change the constitution per referendum, can veto laws per referendum, can even pass laws per referendum.\nThis has implications for politicians however: Because the people make the policies either way, the Swiss coalition system has to include as many forces as possible. The four big parties of Switzerland, SVP, FDP, CVP and SP, are constantly in government together - this makes national elections in Switzerland more or less useless - as the people rule not through their representatives, but through referendums."
