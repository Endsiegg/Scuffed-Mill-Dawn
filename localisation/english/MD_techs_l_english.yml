 NAVAL_TITLE_CORVETTE: "CORVETTES"
 NAVAL_TITLE_CORVETTE_DESC: "The smallest class of vessel considered a warship, Corvette class ships are not typically part of ‘blue water’ navies. These small and fast ships are usually armed with an assortment of weapons, allowing them to perform a range of duties. Many countries can float Corvettes due to their affordability for small and medium-sized navies.They are typically used for: coast defense and surveillance, minesweeping, anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, anti-ship and, in modern times, land attack duties."
 NAVAL_TITLE_FRIGATE: "FRIGATES"
 NAVAL_TITLE_FRIGATE_DESC: "Forming the core of many modern navies, Frigates can be used as part of ‘blue water’ naval forces. They have an extended range and are larger compared to the Corvette class of ship. Though most often used as a platform for fleet defense, they can perform a fairly extensive range of roles within a fleet and can be customized to meet the demands of many different roles and situations (including more offensive-minded tasks). They are typically used for: fleet defense, anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, and maritime convoy duties."
 NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_DESTROYERS: "MISSILE DESTROYERS"
 NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_DESTROYERS_DESC: "Intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group, these fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warships are equally capable of independent operation. Later iterations, carrying a wide and deadly array of guided missiles, cruise missiles, and other weapons, are indeed multi-mission warships. Heavier in tonnage, and more offensive and deadly in firepower, than your Frigate or Corvette.

 NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_CRUISERS_DESC: "Typically the largest assault ships in a modern fleet (besides Aircraft Carriers and Amphibious Assault ships), these powerful assets can cover the entire globe's oceans and seas. Historically geared toward Air Defense (while Destroyers were tasked with Surface Warfare), modern Cruisers have an incredible arsenal of weapons at their disposal – greater than any other combat ship. Cruisers can be used as the basis for an entire battle group, with a large capacity for sensors and combat management systems.

Capable of operating helicopters, STOVL (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing) fixed-wing aircraft, as well as Marine assault craft, many also have a well deck – granting swift amphibious assaults on enemy positions. These ships provide a huge support bonus to any amphibious landings.

With a vast range, they require a true ‘blue water’ battle group to allow them to fulfill their full range of operational abilities at sea. Any country fielding a fully operational Carrier Battle Group can be truly proud of what their navy represents, and the horrifying power it wields.

In order to attack the whole ICBM fleet and do any significant damage, the enemy would have to attack every silo. With enough silos, they would use up much of their warhead inventory to destroy only a couple of missiles, a cost that was so high they would not contemplate it."

When the first warhead went off, it would create a huge cloud of debris that was ejected thousands of feet into the sky. When the next warhead arrived it would hit this debris and be destroyed. This strategy is also known as 'dust defense'."

Interceptions during the terminal phase are among the simplest, both technically and in terms of tracking. Against a large attack with many warheads, there may be little time to arrange all of the interceptions. More importantly, waiting until the last moment necessarily means the interception takes place at shorter range which means protecting a large area may require a very large number of interceptor bases spread over that area."
 boost_phase_defense: "Boost Phase Defense"
 boost_phase_defense_desc: "The boost phase is the portion of the flight of a missile during which the booster and sustainer engines operate until it reaches peak velocity. Boost-phase intercept is a type of missile defense technology that would be designed to disable enemy missiles while they are still in the boost phase. Such defenses have the advantage of being able to easily track their targets through the infrared signature of the rocket exhaust, and that boosters are generally much less robust than the warheads. Destroying the booster also destroys all of the warheads and decoys."

 reactor1: "Magnox"
 reactor1_desc: "Magnox reactors are designed to run on natural uranium with carbon dioxide gas as the coolant. Earliest types were constructed in the late 1950's right into the 70's until Light Water reactors replaced most of them. Its simple design and low power density made it a safe and cost-effective reactor for being a Gen I reactor."
 reactor2: "LWR"
 reactor2_desc: "Light-water reactor is an umbrella term for reactors using normal water for its coolant and neutron moderator. Its three varieties are the most common type of nuclear reactors as it's design is simpler and cheaper. Technological breakthroughs after previous reactors rendered these as GEN II 'Commercial Power Reactors'."
 reactor3: "ABWR"
 reactor3_desc: "Advanced Boiling water reactor is a type built on previous boiling water systems for improved output. Its state of the art boiling system makes it the earliest Gen III reactor. Multiple new additions in safety and an addition of digital controls gives the reactors a huge leap ahead of earlier reactor designs."
 reactor4: "System 80+"
 reactor4_desc: "This updated version of System 80 Pressurized Water reactor marks many changes for improved costs and safety. The powerful reactor can handle not only civilian grade plutonium but even military-grade in such a way to also store it for future use."
 reactor5: "AP1000"
 reactor5_desc: "Further improvements in the technology surrounding pressurized water has cut down cost and increased efficiency. A passive safety system in place requires less manpower for the same performance. The first smaller design (AP600) was not considered cost-effective enough even if it were among the world's first GEN III reactors."
 reactor6: "VVER-1200"
 reactor6_desc: "Increased capacity and fuel efficiency takes nuclear fission to new heights. Refined modern safety systems and new refueling cycles extends not only the lifespan but also top efficiency to at least 90%."
 reactor7: "APWR"
 reactor7_desc: "Advanced pressurized water reactor features several design enhancements including a neutron reflector, improved efficiency and improved safety systems. It integrates active and passive systems with two more trains to lower the risk even further."
 reactor8: "CFR-1000"
 reactor8_desc: "Its smaller predecessor (CFR-600) was designed as to test new methods with liquid sodium instead of the \"usual\" water coolant. The CFR-1000 is its larger commercial scale reactor but could easily handle weapon-grade plutonium as well."
 reactor9: "MSR"
 reactor9_desc: "Molten Salt reactor utilitzes a special mixture which makes the reactor work in near atmospheric pressures unlike the \"usual\" normal water coolant does. It also absorbs radioactive gases emitted from the core. This reduces the need of large, expensive containment structures."
