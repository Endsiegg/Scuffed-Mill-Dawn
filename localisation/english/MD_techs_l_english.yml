 body_armor_1980: "Kevlar Vest"
 body_armor_1980_desc: "The first modern body armours before the famous Kevlar vests were mainly made of nylon.

 body_armor_2000: "Plate Reinforced Vest"
 body_armor_2000_desc: "Even though ceramics have been used in personal protection for long, the first modern ballistic plates were introduced in late 90s and early 2000s.

 body_armor_2010: "Improved Tactical Vest"
 body_armor_2010_desc: "While offering great protection, plate reinforced vests can be cumbersome to the user. This lead to several body armour manufacturers to look for more lighter and tactical designs. While also providing protection, body armour shouldn't limit a soldiers ability to operate on the field. Modern body armours offer integrated solutions where the tactical vests allow personal customisation by the user, making the same vest usable in almost every situation. The protective capabilities are also improved, as modern body armour is capable of even stopping armour piercing bullets."

This mimics the colour schemes of nature, making the camouflage more effective in multiple environments and at varying ranges."
 camouflage3: "Digital Camouflage"

 carrier_hull_5: "2045 Carrier Hull"
 carrier_hull_5_desc: "These floating airbases are the pinnacle of naval power, able to reach out into the world’s oceans to project a nation's power across the entire globe. Signifying a strong nation's blood and treasure, these incredibly valuable assets must be protected at all costs. With a vast range, they require a true ‘blue water’ battle group to allow them to fulfill their full range of operational abilities at sea. Any country fielding a fully operational Carrier Battle Group can be truly proud of what their navy represents, and the horrifying power it wields. They are typically used for: power projection far and wide, air warfare, surface warfare, amphibious warfare."

 tech_submarine_engineering_1: "Early Submarine Engine"
 tech_submarine_engineering_1_desc: "The diesel-electric power used in early submarines consisted of a diesel engine, an electric motor, a generator, and a battery. The propeller was a diesel engine connected in parallel with an electric motor. The diesel engine could be used for navigation on the water, or the diesel engine could be used to drive the generator to charge the battery. When the ship was submerged, the air supply was limited and the oxygen-consuming heat engine could not operate; the battery would provide energy for the electric motor, which would drive the propeller with electricity."

Though most often used as a platform for fleet defense, they can perform a fairly extensive range of roles within a fleet and can be customized to meet the demands of many different roles and situations (including more offensive-minded tasks).

 reactor1: "Magnox"
 reactor1_desc: "Magnox reactors are designed to run on natural uranium with carbon dioxide gas as the coolant. Earliest types were constructed in the late 1950's right into the 70's until Light Water reactors replaced most of them. Its simple design and low power density made it a safe and cost-effective reactor for being a Gen I reactor."
 reactor2: "LWR"
 reactor2_desc: "Light-water reactor is an umbrella term for reactors using normal water for its coolant and neutron moderator. Its three varieties are the most common type of nuclear reactors as it's design is simpler and cheaper. Technological breakthroughs after previous reactors rendered these as GEN II 'Commercial Power Reactors'."
 reactor3: "ABWR"
 reactor3_desc: "Advanced Boiling water reactor is a type built on previous boiling water systems for improved output. Its state of the art boiling system makes it the earliest Gen III reactor. Multiple new additions in safety and an addition of digital controls gives the reactors a huge leap ahead of earlier reactor designs."
 reactor4: "System 80+"
 reactor4_desc: "This updated version of System 80 Pressurized Water reactor marks many changes for improved costs and safety. The powerful reactor can handle not only civilian grade plutonium but even military-grade in such a way to also store it for future use."
 reactor5: "AP1000"
 reactor5_desc: "Further improvements in the technology surrounding pressurized water has cut down cost and increased efficiency. A passive safety system in place requires less manpower for the same performance. The first smaller design (AP600) was not considered cost-effective enough even if it were among the world's first GEN III reactors."
 reactor6: "VVER-1200"
 reactor6_desc: "Increased capacity and fuel efficiency takes nuclear fission to new heights. Refined modern safety systems and new refueling cycles extends not only the lifespan but also top efficiency to at least 90%."
 reactor7: "APWR"
 reactor7_desc: "Advanced pressurized water reactor features several design enhancements including a neutron reflector, improved efficiency and improved safety systems. It integrates active and passive systems with two more trains to lower the risk even further."
 reactor8: "CFR-1000"
 reactor8_desc: "Its smaller predecessor (CFR-600) was designed as to test new methods with liquid sodium instead of the \"usual\" water coolant. The CFR-1000 is its larger commercial scale reactor but could easily handle weapon-grade plutonium as well."
 reactor9: "MSR"
 reactor9_desc: "Molten Salt reactor utilitzes a special mixture which makes the reactor work in near atmospheric pressures unlike the \"usual\" normal water coolant does. It also absorbs radioactive gases emitted from the core. This reduces the need of large, expensive containment structures."
 reactor10: "VHTR"
 reactor10_desc: "Fourth generation Very-high-temperature reactor is capable of using helium or molten salt as a coolant. The core will be surrounded with even more trains and highly advanced safety systems."
