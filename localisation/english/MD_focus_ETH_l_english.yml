 ETH_glorify_the_italo_ethiopian_wars_desc: "Countries, nations and nationalism are forged in conflict. Ethiopia was forged on the battlefields of 1895 and 1935.

 ETH_restore_the_throne: "Restore the Throne"
 ETH_restore_the_throne_desc: "The Crown Council, now empowered in the political decision-making process, has suggested to officially proclaim the restoration of the Ethiopian Empire. It just takes... well, a new constitution."

 ETH_guarantee_freedom_of_speech: "Guarantee Freedom of Speech"
 ETH_guarantee_freedom_of_speech_desc: "Ethiopia is religiously, ethnically and politically diverse.

Under his reign between 1977 and 1991, Ethiopia saw hyper-militarization, suppression of dissent and civil war. He fled to Zimbabwe in 1991 and was, during his absence, convicted of genocide by an Ethiopian court. Actually, genocide and dictatorship aren't all that bad after all.

 ETH_eritrea_arrest_leaders: "Condemn Afwerki"
 ETH_eritrea_arrest_leaders_desc: "Isaias Afwerki's trial date is due, it likely won't be a good time for him, nor should it be.

 ETH_detain_rabble_rousers: "Detain Potential Separatist Leaders"
 ETH_detain_rabble_rousers_desc: "During the trial, extra security was posted all around the courthouse, thankfully, they weren't needed. However, they did manage to pick out some notable figures, these rabble rousers should be detained lest they get any ideas for antagonism..."

 ETH_eritrea_annex_desc: "Since 1991, Eritrea has been independent, it was ruled as a one party state under the dictatorial regime of Afwerki. Now that we have well and truly defeated this regime and worn down the resistance of the local populous, we can institute our own governance entirely."

# INTEGRATION EFFORTS
 ETH_eritrea_teach_amharic: "Teach Them Amharic"
 ETH_eritrea_teach_amharic_desc: "How can we expect to rule over the Eritrean people if they can't understand us?

 ETH_eritrea_propaganda: "Propaganda Distribution Network"
 ETH_eritrea_propaganda_desc: "Whilst calling it 'propaganda' may be crass, it is necessary to distribute documents that tout the benefits of Ethiopian rule, the larger our propaganda network, the more of it we can distribute, and the easier it'll be show the Eritreans our point of view."

 ETH_eritrea_assembly: "Allow Eritrean Branches of Ethiopian Parties"
 ETH_eritrea_assembly_desc: "Whilst we condemn the solidification of power that Afwerki had, it may be necessary to exploit the power structures there in order to push for federalisation, by allowing our own parties to form branches and then run for elections within Eritrea, Ethiopia friendly candidates who are in favour of the Federation Act will almost certainly win, and thus we can achieve our goals in integrating the former Eritrean state as an autonomous region of the new Ethiopia."
 ETH_eritrea_lawbooks: "Rewrite the Lawbooks"
 ETH_eritrea_lawbooks_desc: "The Eritrean laws on the books are primitive and outdated, no-one should need to register with the government on what faith to practice as an example, we need to rewrite these laws to better emphasise the fact that we are and will be a modern Federation."
 ETH_eritrea_constitution: "Write a New Constitution"
 ETH_eritrea_constitution_desc: "The old Eritrean constitution was so unfit for purpose, it wasn't even properly implemented, we need to rewrite a constitution that complements our own, rather than combats it, and make sure it actually gets implemented correctly this time."

 ETH_eritrean_federal_state_desc: "Finally, our efforts have paid off, the final steps are expected to go through and both Ethiopians and Eritreans have been reported embracing one another in the streets and markets. A goal once thought impossible not even a decade ago, has been made possible."

 ethiopia.5.t: "The African Alliance"
 ethiopia.5.d: "It was Ethiopia whose flag defined the colors of the Pan-African movement due to our prolonged resistance against European colonialism. It was Ethiopia shaping generations of young black Africans both inside and outside our borders to be strong and proud African nationalists. It was Ethiopia that followed the doctrine of unity in diversity across the African continent.\n\nBut unity and diversity are no longer enough. The European colonial powers of old are eyeing greedily at their former African possessions, aiming to once again carve out economic spheres of interest for their mega-corporations. Chinese investments from the far east are both a blessing and a curse, as China aims to establish itself as an equal to the great powers of old. The United States has long abandoned her doctrine of freedom and liberty in favor of a doctrine of oil and money.\n\nAfrica needs to stand together and unite under the flag of one common military alliance to resist both American and Russian, both Chinese and Indian ambitions to form military blocs.\n\nWe shall send invitations to all eligible African Union members. Except for Eritrea. We will conveniently forget Eritrea."
 ethiopia.5.a: "For Africa! For Humanity!"
 ethiopia.6.t: "Invitation to the African Alliance"
 ethiopia.6.d: "In daring defiance to European and East Asian diplomatic influence, the Ethiopian government aims to reform the African Union into a complete military bloc. We are eligible to join due to the fact that we are an African Union member not already entangled in another alliance.\n\nBut should we surrender our sovereignty and neutrality in favor of the African Alliance? Or is the African Alliance our key to sovereignty and neutrality in the first place?"
 ethiopia.6.a: "Africa stands as one!"
 ethiopia.6.b: "Oh, I don't think so."
 ethiopia.7.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail finished"
 ethiopia.7.d: "The Addis Ababa Light Rail finally finished its construction phase and were now going on to the testing. The Light Rail was originally intended to have a total of 41 stations on its two lines (of which 39 were finished) and each train has a capacity to carry 286 passengers. This will enable the light rail transit to provide a transportation service to 15,000 passengers per hour per direction and 60,000 in all four directions while the fares cost 2-6 Ethiopian birr.\n\nThe railway was contracted by the China Railway Group Limited and it is operated by the Shenzhen Metro Group. Addis Ababa Light Rail currently has a fleet of 41 three-section 70% low-floor trams manufactured by CNR Changchun."
 ethiopia.7.a: "Finally no more traffic jam's!"
 ethiopia.8.t: "Ethio-Djibouti Railways stops its operations"
 ethiopia.8.d: "After World War II, the railway began a long period of decline. Traffic on the railway dropped in half from 1953 to 1957, as road transport began to compete for cargo. The Ogaden War of 1977–1978 dealt a further blow to the railway, as Somali troops invaded us and captured the railway as far as Dire Dawa. Portions of the railway were blown up in the war, and railway operations were again cut in half. After the war ended, the railway continued to decline from a lack of maintenance and attacks from rebels such as the Ogaden Liberation Front.\n\nBoth the lack of maintenance and an ambitious road construction program made rail transport increasingly non-competitive. In January 1985, the Awash rail disaster killed 429 passengers when their train derailed on the Awash River Bridge and fell into the gorge below. Railway service finally ended this year between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, but trains continued to run between Dire Dawa and Djibouti. The tracks between Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa fell into total disrepair, and many of the rails were stolen and sold for scrap."
 ethiopia.8.a: "We should have repaired it earlier"
 ethiopia.9.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail expanded"
 ethiopia.9.d: "The new line built is completely grade-separated. Apart from extending the existing lines, two new lines were built. The first one start at St. George's Cathedral, pass along Mexico Square to the African Union Headquarters and terminate at Lebu, connecting to the new national rail network. The second line start at Megenagna Roundabout and passes via Bole Airport, Wello Sefer area, Saris market area and Jommo area and terminates at Lebu."

 ethiopia.11.t: "EPLF Takes Up Arms... Again!"
 ethiopia.11.d: "For the second time since the end of World War 2, Eritrea has found itself under Ethiopian occupation. Many former high ranking politicians and military leaders have managed to escape the Ethiopian forces and have gone into a self imposed exile in Sudan. From there, they have seemingly refounded the Eritrean Liberation Front.\n\nThe original EPLF transformed itself into the People's Front for Democracy and Justice shortly after Eritrean independence from Ethiopia in 1991 and acted as the sole legal party of Eritrea until its recent dismantling. Since Isaias' recent capture and subsequent house arrest, his presidential advisor Yemane Gebreab has reportedly taken over the remnants of the party and is rallying the remnants into taking up arms under the EPLF's banner once more."

 # ethiopia.12.t: "Military convoy raided by ELPF"
 # ethiopia.12.d: "In an surprising attack on one of our military convoys in the region of Eritrea, the entire convoy got wiped out and its load stolen. The Eritrean Liberation Front, which took responsibility for this ambush, got away before any reinforcements could arrive to the scene."
 # ethiopia.12.a: "They will need more to stop us!"
 ethiopia.13.t: "Isaias Afewerki Arrested"
 ethiopia.13.d: "As the gunfire around Asmara quietened and Eritrea's last stalwart defenders laid down their arms, Isaias Afwerki and his most loyal men were already en route to neighbouring Sudan in a relatively non descript motorcade, a last-ditch desperate attempt to escape Ethiopian justice. His bodyguards put up what little resistance they could muster, but the numbers were simply not on their side.\n\nIsaias Afewerki was promptly apprehended and bundled into a military vehicle bound for Addis Ababa, his fate remains uncertain but until then, he remains under house arrest, guarded by Ethiopia's finest soldiers."
 ethiopia.13.a: "Justice will be served."
 ethiopia.14.t: "The Trial of Isaias Afewerki"
 ethiopia.14.d: "Today marks the trial date of the former leader of Eritrea; Isaias Afwerki. Amongst the already loud court proceedings, Isaias could be heard over all others, protesting his situation. As the cameras turned towards him as he entered the chambers, he retorted accusations of corruption from the court and the Ethiopian justice system overall, claiming that the trial was nothing more than a dog and pony show as his fate had already been decided far ahead of any proceedings.\n\nMany international reporters and observers of the trial sympathetic to his situation echoed his concerns, but the cries of corruption and rigged proceedings cannot save the purported tyrant of Eritrea. He is quickly given the guilty verdict after multiple days of deliberation and after reviewing all the evidence, his sentence is..."
 ethiopia.14.a: "...death."
 ethiopia.14.b: "...life imprisonment."
 # ethiopia.15.t: "The Guilt of Isaias Afwerki"
 # ethiopia.15.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. The sitting was long, but at the end of the day the decision was made, Isaya gets imprisoned for life.\n\nThis sentence wasn't surprising to anyone and he will be transferred as soon as possible to a jail on the Eritrean side."
 # ethiopia.15.a: "He deserve that"
 # ethiopia.16.t: "The End of Isaias Afwerki"
 # ethiopia.16.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. The sitting was long, but at the end of the day the decision was made, Isaya will face the death sentence.\n\nThis sentence wasn't made since 1998, when an Eritrean businessman gunned down an popular Ethiopian general and thus is quite special.\n\nAlmost immediately after the judgment was made, armed police officers escorted him out of the hall where he faced his sentence."
 # ethiopia.16.a: "He was a bad guy"
 # ethiopia.17.t: "Local police station attacked by ELPF"
 # ethiopia.17.d: "In the middle of the day three trucks stopped in front of the police station and armed men opened instantly fire upon the poor officers in the building.\n\nNone of them survived and the weapon safe was plundered.

Today is his official coronation as His Imperial Majesty Emperor Amha Selassie I, Elect of God, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah and King of Kings of Ethiopia.\n\nTogether with his only child he holds on front of the cathedral, which got decorated with the imperial banners, and steps towards the entrance. Inside the cathedral is everyone from importance in Ethiopia awaiting in eager the coronation.\n\nAs Zera walks towards the Presbyter, his heart begin to beat faster. This is truly a moment he wont forget and he could not even imagine in his craziest dreams. The ceremony itself was pretty fast over and as he walks out as the legitimate king of Ethiopia, everyone bows for him."

 ethiopia.20.d: "The recent conflict between our neighbors and the refusal of cooperation between Eritrea and Ethiopia has resulted in something far more devastating. The country has fallen into a famine and people are beginning to die as the food market in the country is strangled by the lack of cooperation from our neighbors.
