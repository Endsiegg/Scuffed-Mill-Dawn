 libya_oil_nationalisation: "Oil Nationalisation"
 libya_oil_nationalisation_desc: "Libya has Africa's largest and the world's 10th largest oil reserves. Libya's oil industry is so important that it makes up 95% of all industries in the country. Oil reserves of Libya are an attractive investment target as production costs are low, the oil has low sulphur content and Libya is very close to the European market. However, as a result of sanctions, issues with foreign oil companies and tight state hold on the oil fields, Libya has reached a state where it barely has the resources to maintain its existing production. Any further increase in oil production would require considerable investment, either from abroad or from home.\n\nCurrent Level of Nationalisation: §Y[?lba_oil_nationalisation|%0]§!"
 libya_nationalise_oil_fields: "Nationalise Oil Fields"
 libya_nationalise_oil_fields_desc: "We can nationalise some of the privately run oil fields in Libya. This will cost us quite a lot of money, but it will make our oil production more independent"
 libya_sell_oil_fields: "Sell National Oil Fields"
 libya_sell_oil_fields_desc: "We can sell some of the oil fields run by the National Oil Corporation to foreign companies. We can make a quick buck but it will make our energy sector more reliant on other countries"
 libya_develop_oil_field_cost_bad_tt: "The base cost of developing an oil field in el-Sahara is §Y$3 billion§!. This is increased by [?lba_oil_nationalisation|%0R] because of our §YLevel of Nationalisation§!"

 libya_develop_el_sahara_fields: "Develop the el-Sharara Oil Fields"
 libya_develop_el_sahara_fields_desc: "The el-Sharara oil fields are located in the Wadi al Hayaa district in Southern Libya. It is a minor oil field on the scale of Libya but still an important one. The oil refined here is processed and stored in §YMellitah and az-Zawiyah near Tripoli§!. With increased effort, we can expand the production in el-Sahara.\n\nIn order to expand our existing oil fields, we need to prepare facilities to store the oil and find efficient methods for extracting the oil."
 libya_develop_west_waha_fields: "Develop Western Waha Oil Fields"
 libya_develop_west_waha_fields_desc: "The Waha oil fields in the Sirte Basin produces 90% of Libyan oil, making it the most valuable region in the country. The extracted oil from the Western Waha fields is sent to §YSirte and Lanuf§! for refining and storage. With increased effort, we can expand the production in Western Waha.\n\nIn order to expand our existing oil fields, we need to prepare facilities to store the oil and find efficient methods for extracting the oil."
 libya_develop_east_waha_fields: "Develop Eastern Waha Oil Fields"
 libya_develop_east_waha_fields_desc: "The Waha oil fields in the Sirte Basin produces 90% of Libyan oil, making it the most valuable region in the country. The extracted oil from the Eastern Waha fields is sent to §YBrega and Adjabiya§! for refining and storage. With increased effort, we can expand the production in Eastern Waha.\n\nIn order to expand our existing oil fields, we need to prepare facilities to store the oil and find efficient methods for extracting the oil."
 libya_dig_wadi_ash_shati: "Dig for Iron Ore in Wadi Ash-Shati'"
 libya_dig_wadi_ash_shati_desc: "It is rumoured that the Wadi Ash-Shati' valley near Sabha holds the world's largest iron ore deposits. We've only found little but who knows what the desert sands hold? We need to prospect the area to find this iron."
 libya_dig_wadi_ash_shati_capacity: "There is existing potential for new iron mines (current: [?wadi_ash_shati_current] out of 60)"
 libya_dig_wadi_ash_shati_tt: "The §Ylikelihood§! of hitting the motherlode depends on our §YExcavation§! technology. The chance increases by §G2.5%§! per level."
 libya_gaddafi_family: "The Gaddafi Family"
 libya_gaddafi_family_desc: "Muammar Gaddafi, along with his children, hold considerable power in Libya. They all have their own interests and goals. Gaddafi himself is a very eccentric man. Known for his publicity stunts and direct language, many of his behaviours are strange and odd on the international forum. While Gaddafi's methods can be advantageous, it is possible that the Libyan people grow tired of his antics. It is important to keep the instability of the Gaddafi family at a manageable level to secure the stability of the state.\n\nCurrent §YInstability§!: [?gaddafi_family_instability] ([?gaddafi_family_instability_decay|-]/month), Effect: [?gaddafi_family_stability_effect|+%] §YStability§!. If the §YStability§! of [ROOT.GetName] is below §Y15%§!, the people will start protesting against Gaddafi!\n\nEach of Gaddafi's children will affect §YInstability§! by §G-0.25§!/month and their traits will be active unless they are §YExiled§! or §YDead§!.\n\nYou can access §Ydecisions§! related to a character by clicking their portrait."

 libya_gaddafi_family_exile_desc: "Sometimes a child's meddling in Libya's affairs can be too much. They should be exiled and sent away. Perhaps they will learn to improve themselves by spending time away from home.\n\n§WWhen in §YExile§!, characters' leader traits no longer affect our country. However, it is possible they become bitter and start working actively against their father and siblings. A character can always be called back at the cost of §YInstability§!§!"

 libya_gaddafi_family_father_to_son_talk_muhammad_muammar_desc: "Muhammad has never been very interested in politics, despite being the clear successor to his father one day. Perhaps a heart-to-heart talk with his father will send Muhammad back on the right track?"
 libya_gaddafi_family_sensor_internet_muhammad_muammar: "Censor The Internet"
 libya_gaddafi_family_sensor_internet_muhammad_muammar_desc: "In his role as the chairman of the General Posts and Telecommunications Company (GPTC), Muhammad has the power to control the Internet in Libya. We can block harmful sites and censor news content in favour of our regime."
 libya_gaddafi_family_showcase_art_saif_al_islam: "Showcase §YSaif's§! Artwork"
 libya_gaddafi_family_showcase_art_saif_al_islam_desc: "Saif al-Islam is a talented artist (or at the very least, an artist).

 libya_gaddafi_family_discuss_succession_saif_al_islam_desc: "It might be necessary to discuss the order of succession with Saif. Since Muhammad is not that interested in politics, it might be better that on Gaddafi's death, Saif is the one who will rule the country. After all, he is far more interested in politics and is actually good at it."
 saif_al_islam_succession_talk_great_success_tt: "§GSaif gains §YGeopolitical Thinker§!§!"
 saif_al_islam_succession_talk_failure_tt: "§RSaif loses §YMaster Maneuverer§!§!"

The 2nd article claimed that after the publication of the 1st article, the author was invited to Tripoli to 'meet a sinister faith'. Both of these allegations are untrue, and we must sue the paper for libel."
 libya_gaddafi_family_improve_football_career_al_saadi: "Elevate §YAl-Saadi's§! Football Career"
 libya_gaddafi_family_improve_football_career_al_saadi_desc: "Al-Saadi is the president of Libya's football federation and the captain of national football team. However, these positions haven't exactly been achieved with skill but favours from his father. He also gets special treatment in every game he plays.

 al_saadi_football_career_great_success_tt: "§GAl-Saadi loses §YVain Football Star§!§!"
 al_saadi_football_career_talk_failure_tt: "§RAl-Saadi gains §YPlayboy Lifestyle§!§!"
 libya_gaddafi_family_create_new_city_al_saadi: "Create A Business City"
 libya_gaddafi_family_create_new_city_al_saadi_desc: "Al-Saadi has suggested creating a business-oriented city in the West of Libya. This new city would function similar to Hong Kong in China and would be located between Tripoli and the Tunisian border. The city will be open to all foreign investors, with main focus being the technology sector. The city will have its own airport and seaport to make accessing the world easy. With an independent administration, the city would welcome people from all over the world, even allowing the building of synagogues and churches. We should try to seek investors and development companies to take part in this project. While nothing tangible will happen for years, this can be an easy boost for our country."

 libya_gaddafi_family_civilian_education_hannibal_desc: "Hannibal graduated as a Bachelor of Marine Navigation from the Academy of Maritime Studies in Libya.

 libya_gaddafi_family_military_education_hannibal: "Send §YHannibal§! To The Kuznetsov Naval Academy"
 libya_gaddafi_family_military_education_hannibal_desc: "Hannibal graduated as a Bachelor of Marine Navigation from the Academy of Maritime Studies in Libya. Rather than following up with a civilian education, Hannibal should finalise his maritime education in the Kuznetsov Naval Academy in [SOV.GetNameDef]. This should give him some more expertise in naval matters."
 libya_gaddafi_family_send_legal_aid_ayesha: "Send §YAyesha§! To Provide Legal Aid"
 libya_gaddafi_family_send_legal_aid_ayesha_desc: "Ayesha has studied law in the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and she is an excellent lawyer. There are many great statesmen in the world who are wrongly pressured and harassed by the international community for alleged 'crimes against humanity' and 'warcrimes'. We should send Ayesha with her team to provide legal aid to these poor servants of their peoples."

 libya_gaddafi_family_military_training_aid_ayesha_desc: "Ayesha has served in the Libyan Army and has reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. We should send her for further officer training and make her a full general. Maybe we can unlock her hidden potential this way."

 libya_gaddafi_family_hold_un_speech_gaddafi_desc: "Now that we are part of the international community again, we need to take the floor at the UN General Assembly. We must hold a speech berating the Americans and what they have done to the Middle East. We must announce our objection to Israel's Zionism. We must ridicule the West for how they have ridiculed us. Today is the day that Libya sits in the spotlight!"
 libya_gaddafi_family_throw_money_gaddafi: "Throw Money On The Streets"
 libya_gaddafi_family_throw_money_gaddafi_desc: "Many aid organisations and charities operate in Libya. They are however, nothing more than spies trying to control Libya. In addition, all the money they hand out is just worthless. Charity does not motivate people to work. We should prove our point by travelling through Tripoli in a convoy, throwing money to the streets. There it is just as useful as handed out by charities."
 libya_gaddafi_family_design_car_gaddafi: "Design A Car"
 libya_gaddafi_family_design_car_gaddafi_desc: "Muammar Gaddafi is filled with great ideas. Libya is currently suffering from a high traffic fatality rate. We must come up with a new design for a car. This car will be the safest car in the world."

 libya_gaddafi_family_meet_women_gaddafi: "Meet Women"
 libya_gaddafi_family_meet_women_gaddafi_desc: "The women of Europe are oppressed by Christianity. In the West, women are nothing but furniture for men, to be changed when it pleases them.

 libya_gaddafi_family_abolish_switzerland_gaddafi_desc: "Why does Switzerland exist? It is nothing more than an artificial state created by Napoleon, or some other European coloniser. The Swiss are not real people, they are Italian, German or French. The whole country should be dismantled."
 libya_gaddafi_family_abolish_switzerland_gaddafi_tt: "If they accept, they will get a §YClaim§! on a Swiss state and we will gain influence on them. If they are §YNationalist§!, they are more likely to accept\n\n"

 libya_libyan_tribalism: "Libyan Tribalism"
 libya_libyan_tribalism_desc: "Libya is traditionally divided into three regions; Tripolitania in the North-West around the capital, Cyrenaica in the East and Fezzan in the South. Historically, these areas have ruled themselves and the areas were only united by Italian colonisation. While both the Libyan Kingdom and the regime of Muammar Gaddafi have mostly eliminated tribal affiliation, there are still many people in Libya who identify with their tribe before the nation.\n\nThe loyalty level of a region defines which state modifiers they get. If the loyalty value drops too low, a region will revolt. If one of the regions revolts and is annexed back to Libya, they will not be able to organise another one unless the region has been fully pacified. However, the states will still be affected by the state modifiers."

 libya_tribalism_decentralise_state: "Decentralize Power"
 libya_tribalism_decentralise_state_desc: "The most effective way of pleasing all Libyan tribes is to simply reduce the power of the central government. Increased autonomy, even if it is only for a limited time, will make the tribal leaders they have some power."

Tripolitania has a long history of resistance against occupiers, as after World War I it declared independence from Italy as the 'Tripolitanian Republic'.

While stripped of title later by the Italians, the Emir gained back control of the region after World War II at the consent of the British. Two years later, the entirety of Libya was united under the Emirate of Cyrenaica as a Kingdom, with Emir Idris becoming King Idris I. Ever since the fall of the monarchy, Cyrenaica has been the strongest supporter of bringing it back with occasional nationalist activity against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nThe south of Cyrenaica is inhabited by the Toubou people, a nomadic African ethnic group that inhabit Southern Libya, Northern Chad and Northern Niger."

 #Leader descriptions
 LBA_muammar_gaddafi_desc: "Muammar Gaddafi took power in Libya after overthrowing the Libyan monarchy in 1969. He quickly took control of the entire ruling apparatus, and implemented a mix of policies between anti-Western ideals, Islamic socialism and sharia, and Arab nationalism. He eventually concentrated his ideas into the Green Book, which outlined his Third International Theory. While initially a popular leader at home and abroad, Gaddafi became increasing sidelined from international politics. Constant funding of terrorists, revolutionaries and insurgents has left Gaddafi with very few friends on the international stage. Gaddafi's actions have left the once oil rich nation of Libya suffering under international pressure and sanctions, and is at the risk of becoming an international pariah."
 LBA_abdulrahman_sewehli_desc: "Abdulrahman Sewehli is the grandson Ramadan Asswehly, the founder of the Tripolitanian Republic.

 LBA_khweldi_hameidi_desc: "Khweldi Hameidi is one of the closest allies of Muammar Gaddafi. He took part in the coup in 1969, and after Gaddafi's purges Hameidi ended up in his inner circle. Throughout his career, Hameidi has served as interior minister, chief of military intelligence and head of the military courts. One of Hameidi's daughters is married to Al-Saadi Gaddafi. After Gaddafi was ousted from power, Hameidi formed the Libyan Popular Movement with other Gaddafi loyalists."

 LBA_saif_al_islam_gaddafi_desc: "Saif al-Islam is the second son of Muammar Gaddafi. He has a degree in engineering (or achitecture, depending on the source). Saif al-Islam has actively taken part in Libyan politics, and he has even spoken publicly against his father and how Libya needs reform. Reportedly, he was offered the role of Prime Minister and the position of the successor to Muammar Gaddafi, both of which he denied, stating that Libya 'is not a farm to inherit'."
 LBA_al_saadi_gaddafi_desc: "Al-Saadi Gaddafi is the 3rd son of Muammar Gaddafi. He is most known for his career in Libyan football, though his feats are nothing spectacular. Many of his matches were fixed in his favour, and announcers in matches were forbidden from announcing anyone else but him by name, others would only be announced by their jersey number. Generally, Al-Saadi is seen as the black sheep of the family, and there are rumours that he was forced to marry a military commander's daughter to silence talk of his possible bisexuality."
 LBA_mutassim_gaddafi_desc: "Mutassim Gaddafi is the 4th son of Muammar Gaddafi. While his experience was only from the Libyan military, he was still allowed to be part of Muammar Gaddafi's inner circle."

While a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and someone with close ties to Qatar, al-Sallabi was one of the main mediators in negotiations between Gaddafi and the LIFG. Many of his political followers have been members of Al-Qaeda and the LIFG, so whether his true allegiance rests with the Brotherhood or a more extremist form of Islam is unclear."
 LBA_abdelhakim_belhaj_desc: "Abdelhakim Belhaj founded the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in the 1980s, with the goal of getting rid of Muammar Gaddafi. However, before being able to do anything, the LIFG was already driven out of the country.

 LBA_baathism_yemen: "Ba'athism In Yemen"
 LBA_baathism_yemen_desc: "In Yemen, the Iraqi-dominated Ba'athist Party is allied closely with the ruling General People's Congress. By being in good contact with the Ba'athists in Yemen, we will have great access to the Yemeni government."
 LBA_revise_green_book: "Revise The Green Book"
 LBA_revise_green_book_desc: "In 1975 Muammar Gaddafi released his Green Book that detailed his political ideology. It rejects representative democracy in favour of direct democracy, and rejects both capitalism and communism. Essentially, it lays down the foundation for the Third International Theory. However, many elements of the Libyan society today don't follow the Green Book. Maybe it is time to bring the book to the current millenia and chart the future path for Libyans."
 LBA_revise_green_book_tt: "\n[LBA.GetLeader] will revise the Green Book. With each rewritten chapter, our country moves towards or away from §YReform§!.

 LBA_green_book_part_1_1: "1:1 - The Instrument Of Government"
 LBA_green_book_part_1_1_desc: "The most important political question is 'what form of government should be established?' Such a government should be a direct democracy, but what usually occurs is that representative democracies are established, which usurp the will of large populations who did not vote for existing governments, using first-past-the-post electoral systems."
 LBA_green_book_part_1_3: "1:3 - The Party"
 LBA_green_book_part_1_3_desc: "Political parties themselves also usurp the people's authority, and focus on maintaining power instead of improving society for all, the proper object of government. Worse, political parties are susceptible to corruption."
 LBA_green_book_part_1_8: "1:8 - Who Supervises the Conduct of Society?"
 LBA_green_book_part_1_8_desc: "Just as political power should not be delegated to representatives, policing power also should not be delegated away from the entire society. Again, the structure of Conferences and Committees is the solution. The Whole is the legislature for the Whole, and the Whole is the law enforcement for the Whole."
 LBA_green_book_part_1_10: "1:10 - The Press"
 LBA_green_book_part_1_10_desc: "While individuals and companies have the right to express themselves in a private capacity, 'the press' as a means of expression for society must be issued by the Conferences and Committees. Otherwise, individuals would again usurp power away from others in the realm of ideas."
 LBA_green_book_part_2_13: "2:13 - Housing"
 LBA_green_book_part_2_13_desc: "The rental of housing, for example, is exploitation, and infringes the freedom of the renter. Ideally, everyone should have only one house, because if a given party has more than one property, they will be inclined to rent it, thereby exploiting their renters."
 LBA_green_book_part_2_14: "2:14 - Income"
 LBA_green_book_part_2_14_desc: "Individual income is essential to an economy. Again, such income should not be realized as wages paid by an owner, but as the result of partnership in an industry."
 LBA_green_book_part_2_16: "2:16 - Land"
 LBA_green_book_part_2_16_desc: "Land, like all of the aforementioned categories, should be equally available to all. In general, the economy is a zero-sum game, and components of the economy should therefore be distributed equally among all, to produce equality of outcome. No one has the right to save for themselves beyond their own needs, except up to their own arithmetic share of a given good among the whole population."
 LBA_green_book_part_3_21: "3:21 - The Merits of the Tribe"
 LBA_green_book_part_3_21_desc: "Tribes are rooted in blood, provide social cohesion, able to internally monitor themselves due to their numbers. They also ensure the socialization of their individuals, an education more useful than a school education."
 LBA_green_book_part_3_24: "3:24 - Minorities"
 LBA_green_book_part_3_24_desc: "Minorities are of two types: those already having a nation, and those having none, making their own. Either way, their rights must be protected."
 LBA_green_book_part_3_25: "3:25 - Black People Will Prevail In The World"
 LBA_green_book_part_3_25_desc: "Black people are poised to dominate the human population because their culture includes polygamy and shuns birth control, and because they live in a climate which is 'continuously hot', with the result that work is less important for them than in other cultures."
 LBA_green_book_part_3_28: "3:28 - Sport, Horsemanship and Stage"
 LBA_green_book_part_3_28_desc: "Spectatorship in sports, theater and other entertainments is foolish. People should engage in sports directly, deriving the benefits of athletics for themselves, rather than standing by and watching others perform."
 LBA_release_new_green_book: "Release The New Green Book"
 LBA_release_new_green_book_desc: "It is finished! After months of hard work, the Green Book has received a new edition. Students all over the country rejoice, as they now have one more book to learn!"
 LBA_empower_peoples_congresses: "Empower People's Congresses"
 LBA_empower_peoples_congresses_desc: "What started out as a way to bring direct democracy to people has developed in a farce of neighbours spying on each other to guard the state against revolutionary activity. The Revolutionary Committees that spy on the people need to be abolished and the power needs to be returned to the people"
 LBA_retain_political_balance: "Retain Political Balance"

 LBA_empower_revolutionary_committees: "Empower Revolutionary Committees"
 LBA_empower_revolutionary_committees_desc: "The Revolutionary Committees already effectively control the nation. It should not be too difficult to make the power of the People's Congresses be nominal only, with the Revolutionary Committees being the true masters of the nation."
 LBA_allow_political_parties: "Allow Political Parties"
 LBA_allow_political_parties_desc: "Political parties have been banned in Libya ever since Gaddafi took power. However, in order for the people to properly present themselves, they need platforms for that. We should open the political landscape to more actors."

 LBA_allow_royal_family_return: "Allow Return of Royal Family"
 LBA_allow_royal_family_return_desc: "After Gaddafi's coup in 1969, King Idris was left to live in exile. The rest of his family however, wasn't that lucky. His nephew and heir, Hasan as-Senussi along with his family, was put under house arrest. The house was burned down in 1984 and the family was moved to live in a shack at a public beach. Four years later, the family was allowed to move to the UK for Hasan's medical treatment, who died of a stroke only four years later in 1992. His son and the current Crown Prince Mohammed El Senussi still lives in London. Maybe it is time we allow them back?"
 LBA_compensation_to_royals: "Compensation to Royals"
 LBA_compensation_to_royals_desc: "After what they have been through, we should give monetary compensation to the royal family from the state budget. Just a small yearly allowance to let them get back on their feet. With their status returned, they'll be as famous as the British monarchy one day."
 LBA_hunt_down_royals: "Hunt Down Royals"
 LBA_hunt_down_royals_desc: "A handful of Senussi family members still remain overseas in exile. As long as they live, our regime will not be safe. We must assassinate the remaining lineage of the Senussi house."

 LBA_royal_wealth: "Confiscate Royal Wealth"

 LBA_peoples_intelligence_agency: "People's Intelligence Agency"

 LBA_trust_revolutionary_guard: "Trust the Revolutionary Guard"

 LBA_trust_army: "Trust the Army"
 LBA_trust_army_desc: "We have delegated too much of state security to the Revolutionary Guard. We need to shift back the focus to the army."
 LBA_presidential_republic: "Presidential Republic"
 LBA_presidential_republic_desc: "Libya has had a strong leader throughout most of its existence. Even when we transition to democracy, we need a strong leader with authority. As Libya transitions, we should follow the French and Americans models of being ruled by a strong president."
 LBA_federation: "Libyan Federation"
 LBA_federation_desc: "Libya is composed of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan. These regions themselves are then composed of several tribes. For the stability of the nation, it is best to delegate some of the power to regional governments."

 LBA_constitutional_monarch: "Constitutional Monarchy"
 LBA_constitutional_monarch_desc: "Libya was relatively stable under the monarchy. However, after decades of autocracy, we can't subject the Libyan people to it anymore. We should return the monarchy as a powerful symbol of Libya unity, but true political power should still rest with the Libyan people."

 LBA_revive_senussi_order: "Revive The Senussi Order"
 LBA_revive_senussi_order_desc: "The Senussi Order started as a religious organisation that tried to eliminate some of the more 'tribal' beliefs incorporated into Sufi Islam, while at the same time cutting back the more fundamentalist interpretations of the Quran. The Order grew to great power in Libya, until eventually essentially snuffed out by Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi is now gone, and it is time for the Senussi Order to rise again."
 LBA_approach_nato: "Approach NATO"
 LBA_approach_nato_desc: "The Kingdom of Libya was originally founded with the help of the British and other Western powers. In our first days, we cooperated closely with our European friends, until the Arab nationalist fools pushed us away. We need to repair these relations and return back to our original friends."
 LBA_call_back_exiles: "Call Back Exiles"

 LBA_fatherly_leader: "The Fatherly Leader"
 LBA_fatherly_leader_desc: "The current title for Gaddafi is the 'Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya'. But the truth is, Gaddafi is more closer to a father to the nation, rather than a brother."
 LBA_libyan_military: "The Libyan Military"
 LBA_libyan_military_desc: "The Libyan military, officially the Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, is divided into the army, navy and airforce. Out of these, the army clearly the strongest. The army itself is split into the regular army and the revolutionary guard corps. The reason for this split is that Gaddafi wanted to make sure there was an organisation to keep the regular army loyal."
 LBA_lessons_from_the_past: "Lessons From The Past"
 LBA_lessons_from_the_past_desc: "Throughout our history, we haven't been part of that many wars, and we definitely haven't been on the winning side. We were attacked several times by the US airforce, we had a brief disastrous conflict with Egypt and our war with Chad ended up with us losing a sizeable portion of our military despite the initial victories. If we are to succeed in the future, we must look at what we did wrong."
 LBA_el_dorado_canyon: "Operation El Dorado Canyon"
 LBA_el_dorado_canyon_desc: "In 1986 the United States bombed Libya in response to Libya bombing the West German discotheque 'La Belle' which was popular among American troops. The Americans targeted several military installation, including Gaddafi's command center. The attack destroyed dozens of our aircraft. Our defenses failed completely, as no fighters were launched as counter-action and our anti-air defences didn't start firing until after the American planes were returning. Only 1 F-111 was shot down, and the rest escaped unharmed."
 LBA_better_aa: "Better Anti-Air"

 LBA_better_fighter_response: "Better Fighter Response"
 LBA_better_fighter_response_desc: "Clearly our failure during El Dorado Canyon was our hopelessly slow fighter response. Our flyboys need to be much faster off the ground to intercept any enemies."
 LBA_gulf_of_sidra: "Gulf Of Sidra"
 LBA_gulf_of_sidra_desc: "In 1974, Gaddafi claimed all of Gulf of Sidra as the territorial waters against international maritime law. This was challenged by the United States and eventually led to increased tensions in the Gulf. This ultimately led to several incidents in the region; in 1981 two Libyan SU-22s were shot down, in 1986 one Libyan corvette was sunk and one critically damaged and in 1989 two Libyan MiG-23s were destroyed. In all of these engagements, the Americans suffered no losses. These incidents only showed how hopeless our airforce and navy are."
 LBA_toyota_war_guerrilla: "Toyota War Lessons - Guerrilla Warfare"
 LBA_toyota_war_guerrilla_desc: "The Chadian-Libyan conflict of the 80s ended with the so called Toyota War. Libyan forces had been entrenched in Northern Chad for years. As the Chadians launched their counterattack, they did so on highly mobile technicals (hence the name of the war). This allowed them to bypass the Libyan garrisons, wreaking havoc on supply lines and lone units. This lightweight warfare is what we should focus on too."
 LBA_toyota_war_mobility: "Toyota War Lessons - Mobility"
 LBA_toyota_war_mobility_desc: "The Chadian-Libyan conflict of the 80s ended with the so called Toyota War. Libyan forces had been entrenched in Northern Chad for years. As the Chadians launched their counterattack, they did so on highly mobile technicals (hence the name of the war). This allowed them to outmaneuver Libyan formations, even going toe-to-toe with slower moving tanks and crossing minefields unharmed. This is definitely the style of warfare we need."
 LBA_desert_warfare: "Masters Of The Desert"
 LBA_desert_warfare_desc: "The majority of Libya is desert. No matter which direction we are attacked from, we will most likely be fighting in the heat and the sand. This is something our people are already accustomed to, and our enemies should fear us."

 LBA_egypt_war_behind_the_lines_desc: "In 1977 we fought a short four-day-war against Egypt, mainly due to soured relations over Egypt signing a peace deal with Israel. During the war, a Libyan tank battalion crossed into Egypt but was quickly destroyed by a mechanised counter-attack. In the following days, Egyptian commandos launched multiple raids against Libyan military installations. Those behind-the-line attacks destroyed many critical military installations, and using that tactic against our enemies would be helpful."

During the war, Egyptian commandos raided Libyan military installation. At the same time, a Libyan armoured battalion advanced into Egypt but was quickly destroyed by a Egyptian mechanised counter-attacked, which then advanced 25 km into Libya before returning to their original positions. The awe inspiring Egyptian mechanized assault is something we should aim to achieve."
 LBA_activate_arsenal_of_islam: "Activate Arsenal Of Islam"
 LBA_activate_arsenal_of_islam_desc: "In the 1970s, Gaddafi went on a massive shopping spree and built up a massive 'Arsenal of Islam' to be used when the global war with the United States and Israel would begin.  The war never came but we still need that equipment. Everything in the arsenal is decades old and it will take time and money to get everything running, but at least our soldiers will have something to fight with."

 LBA_sabha_launch_site: "Sabha Launch Site"
 LBA_sabha_launch_site_desc: "In the 1980s, a West German company OTRAG was using the Sabha Oasis as a test site for their experimental space rockets. Originally tested in Shaba in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire), the testing was moved to Libya until 1987. The Sabha launch site was also a remote test site for the Soviet space program until 1991. We could refurbish the launch site to be used for our own testing purposes."
 LBA_review_the_navy: "Review The Navy"
 LBA_review_the_navy_desc: "Our navy is mostly made up of old inoperable Soviet submarines and corvettes from the 1950s and 60s, with a couple of 'newer' Koni-class heavy corvettes. Most of these ships are in very bad shape, and they are really fit only for coastal defence. The navy is in dire need of modernization."

 LBA_refurbish_submarines_desc: "We have two Foxtrot-class submarines. Six in total were bought from the Soviet Union in 1982, but unfortunately four of them have already reached a status where they are completely irrepairable. There are still two sitting at the Benghazi naval base in disrepair. With a small investment, we should be able to make them seaworthy again."

 LBA_shuffle_officers_desc: "One of Gaddafi's tactics to keep the military in check is by rotating officers frequently. Officers are often be changed from one unit to another, and new ones are promoted to take their place. This means there is always plenty of young officers grateful for their promotion, and the dissident officers can be sent to far-away unimportant postings."

 LBA_lock_supplies_desc: "Some of our military supplies are controlled by the Revolutionary Guard Corps. This allows the RGC to control the stockpiles of the regular army. We should put all logistics under the RGC so the military has no chance of revolting, as they will have limited access to arms and ammunition.

In 1984 a nuclear pact was signed with India, but no real actions were taken. As the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Gaddafi tried to use the chaos to unsuccesfully acquire nuclear materials.

He has made no claims to the throne but he tried organise a counter coup as soon as Gaddafi took power, which ended with him spending 30 years as a political prisoner, suffering from frequent torture.

 LibyaFocus.83.b: "Assure our people"
 LibyaFocus.84.t: "Mysterious Weapons Shipment Arrives"
 LibyaFocus.84.d: "Several boxes loaded with ammunition and weapons have made their way into one of our warehouses. We have no idea where these weapons came from, as we haven't ordered them. The markings on the boxes are written in Arabic, and based on the cargo manifest they have at least passed through the port of Djibouti. Where could they have come from?"
 LibyaFocus.84.a: "Who cares?"
 LibyaFocus.85.t: "Skirmishes In Ogaden"
 LibyaFocus.85.d: "We have received reports of a exchange of fire on the Somalia-Ethiopia border. The Ogaden region has been contested by both sides due to a mixture of Ethiopian and Somali clans living in the area, and a lack of demarcation of the official state border.. Based on the information we have now, soldiers of our neighbour crossed the border, and after a brief exchange of fire, retreated back. Our neighbour is refuting these claims, stating that it was our soldiers who crossed the border. It seems tension in the region are growing."
 LibyaFocus.85.a: "Prepare our troops!"
 LibyaFocus.85.b: "Assure our people"
 LibyaFocus.86.t: "Insurgency In Ogaden"
 LibyaFocus.86.d: "There has been increased activity of Somali rebels in the Ogaden region.

 LibyaFocus.86.a: "They are not a threat"
 LibyaFocus.87.t: "The Enemy Crosses The Border"

 LibyaFocus.87.a: "Mobilise the troops!"
 LibyaFocus.88.t: "Ogaden Somalis Rise Up"
 LibyaFocus.88.d: "The Somali insurgents in Ogaden have intensified their operations and attacked several government buildings and military checkpoints. We have definite evidence that the men and suppliers are crossing the border from Somalia, and are being supported by the local governments. It seems that Somali hunger to unite with Ogaden has once again flared. We must extinguish these dreams as soon as possible."
 LibyaFocus.88.a: "Tell our soldiers to end this insurgency!"
 LibyaFocus.89.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Occupies Socotra"
 LibyaFocus.89.d: "At early hours today, a transport plance of the Libyan military landed on the island of socotra. The plane unloaded soldiers, who quickly disarmed and detained our confused local military units. As the air and seaports had been secured, ships with heavier equipment started coming in. There has been no explanation or answer from [FROM.GetAdjective] officials."
 LibyaFocus.89.a: "Expel them!"
 LibyaFocus.89.b: "We can't do anything about it"
 LibyaFocus.90.t: "Annexation Of Western Sahara"
 LibyaFocus.90.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] hosted Casablanca accords have resulted in a very favourable resolution from our perspective. The countries partaking the accords have decided that Western Sahara should be part of Morocco."
 LibyaFocus.90.a: "Great"
 LibyaFocus.91.t: "Autonomy For Western Sahara"
 LibyaFocus.91.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] hosted Casablanca accords have resulted in a very favourable resolution from our perspective. All the parties have agreed that the conflict should be solved by giving the West Saharans, or Sahrawi, limited autonomy within Morocco."

 LibyaFocus.91.b: "Great"
 LibyaFocus.92.t: "Independence For Western Sahara"

 LibyaFocus.94.d: "Following the terrorist attack against the World Trace Center in the US and the War on Terror waged by the US, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group has been designated as a terrorist organisation by both the US and UK due to links to Al-Qaeda. LIFG itself has denied any ties to Al-Qaeda, stating that they refused to join the Jihad Osama Bin Laden declared on the West in 1998."
 LibyaFocus.94.a: "They deserve this"

 LibyaFocus.94.c: "This can't be good"
 LibyaFocus.95.t: "Tripolitania Declares Independence"
 LibyaFocus.95.d: "A council of Tripolitanian tribal leaders have announced that they no longer accept the state's authority over their land. According to them, the government has clearly shown that it does not have Tripolitania's best interests in mind. Considering that majority of our Armed Forces come from Tripolitania, it is likely many of them will switch sides. With them, goes one of our major population centres and oil fields. Can we let this happen?"

 LibyaFocus.96.d: "A council of Cyrenaican tribal leaders have announced that they no longer accept the state's authority over their land. According to them, the government has clearly shown that it does not have Cyrenaica's best interests in mind. Luckily, most of our Armed Forces personnel comes from Tripolitania, and it is unlikely many will be swayed to the Cyrenaican side. However, Cyrenaica does hold almost half of our oil reserves. Can we let this happen?"

 LibyaFocus.98.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Demands The Aouzou Strip"

 LibyaFocus.103.d: "Using their influence over our country, the [FROM.GetAdjective] has somehow managed to convince our Energy Minister to give resource drilling rights to the Libyan National Oil Corporation. Despite heavy objections by other politicians, the minister and Chadian owners of the oil fields were more than happy to give control of the fields. Armed men bearing Libyan uniforms quickly replaced the local Chadian guard units at the oil fields, and it seems they are here to stay."

 LibyaFocus.104.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Occupies The [580.GetName]"
 LibyaFocus.104.d: "With our security forces occupied elsewhere, the deserts of the [580.GetName] are basically unpatrolled. Taking advantage of this power vacuum, [FROM.GetNameDef] has sent a small contingent of troops to set up a small base in the town of Aozou.

 LibyaFocus.105.d: "As part of their nuclear disarmament program, the [FROM.GetAdjective] officials have released documents indicating a [ROOT.GetAdjective] national, Friedrich Tinner, as being involved in their nuclear program. Tinner studied and worked under Pakistan's head nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan before being invited by Muammar Gaddafi to lead the Libyan nuclear program in the 1980s. Tinner however, could not achieve much success due to Libya's lack of academic and technical expertise, even with help from Khan.\n\nTinner has now been arrested by us, and is awaiting his fate in custody. What should be done with him?"
 LibyaFocus.105.a: "Lock him up"

 LibyaFocus.107.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Employes Tinner"
 LibyaFocus.107.d: "To our surprise, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] has decided to employ Friedrich Tinner instead of imprisoning him. It seems that they valued his expertise in nuclear research too much not to put them to use."
 LibyaFocus.107.a: "Those snakes!"
 LibyaFocus.108.t: "The Return of Friedrich Tinner"
 LibyaFocus.108.d: "When Friedrich Tinner showed up at the Tripoli airport, we were surprised. It seems that the [FROM.GetAdjective] authorities had no interest in his further imprisonment and he was freely allowed to leave the country. It can only be speculated what prompted them to do this."
 LibyaFocus.108.a: "This has to be a trick, right?"

 #Random Events
 LibyaRandomEvents.1.t: "Cabinet Shuffle"
 LibyaRandomEvents.1.d: "In the year of 2000, Libya made significant changes to its cabinet structure. Twelve ministers in total were replaced, including the Prime Minister (also the General Secretary of the General People's Committee) and Foreign Minister. The role of the Prime Minister went from Muhammad Ahmad al-Mangoush to Imbarek Shamekh, previously the Minister of Housing and Utilities."
 LibyaRandomEvents.1.a: "A stable government for a stable nation"
 LibyaRandomEvents.1.b: "Shamekh will be a great Prime Minister"
 LibyaRandomEvents.1.c: "The Foreign Minister change was important"
 LibyaRandomEvents.2.t: "Anti-Black Riots"
 LibyaRandomEvents.2.d: "Libya is a common place for African migrants to end up in. Most these migrants live in the country illegally without any paperwork. These migrants are often targeted by youth gangs. There has been a flare-up of violence recently, with hundreds of migrant homes burned and dozens killed. Many African countries are blaming the state's security forces for negligence, as no arrests have been made."
 LibyaRandomEvents.2.a: "Promise to conduct a proper investigation"
 LibyaRandomEvents.2.b: "Make a few arrests for show"
 LibyaRandomEvents.2.c: "This is what happens when you come here illegally"
 LibyaRandomEvents.3.t: "Plane Crash Near Marsa al-Brega"
 LibyaRandomEvents.3.d: "Midday today a Short 360 aircraft operated by the Sirte Oil Company crashed into the sea near the town of Marsa al-Brega as it was carrying workers and their families from Tripoli. It is common for oil companies to fly workers between sites and cities as no viable alternative transport method exists. The airplane was carrying 38 people, most of them Libyan and British nationals. 19 of them survived the crash and were rescued from the sea. The aircraft crashed as both of its engines failed, but the exact reason is still unknown."
 LibyaRandomEvents.3.a: "We need to investigate the accident"
 LibyaRandomEvents.3.b: "These things happen"
 LibyaRandomEvents.4.t: "Plane Crash Investigation Finished"
 LibyaRandomEvents.4.d: "The investigation into the Marsa al-Brega plane crash has been finished. The plane crashed due to flooded engines. The plane had flown through a cloud formation, which caused the engines to collect moisture and ice. As the plane reduced altitude, the ice melted and flooded the engines. The senior pilot had ignored weather reports as the weather in Libya 'tends to be mild'. The flight crew had also neglected to turn on the anti-icing system as they were distracted by a conversation on Fokker F28 operating system. In addition, the cabin crew hadn't informed the passengers that their seats could be used as floatation devices. This most likely caused additional deaths due to drowning, as the plane was not equipped with life jackets, which are not required on short flights."
 LibyaRandomEvents.4.a: "The negligence of the flight crew is what caused this"
 LibyaRandomEvents.4.b: "No life jackets? We need better regulation"
 LibyaRandomEvents.4.c: "We just need better planes"

 LibyaRandomEvents.6.d: "With the Libyan economy suffering under international sanctions, there are ongoing discussions if the country's leadership requires a change. There are suggestions that the current Prime Minister should be replaced. The recommended replacement is Shukri Ghanem, director of marketing on the National Oil Corporation. Ghanem has also been director of research for OPEC and worked in several positions in the Ministry of Petroleum and the Ministry of Economy. Should our current Prime Minister be replaced by him?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.6.a: "Make Ghanem the Prime Minister"
 LibyaRandomEvents.6.b: "We should take advantage of his research expertise"
 LibyaRandomEvents.6.c: "Use him as leverage to motivate the current Prime Minister"
 LibyaRandomEvents.7.t: "Source Of Centrifuges Leaked"
 LibyaRandomEvents.7.d: "It has been leaked to the global public press that some of the centrifuges meant for our nuclear program were acquired with the help of Pakistan. The parts were manufactured in Malaysia, then shipped to Libya through Dubai with the help of Pakistan. The sources say that Pakistan has engaged in similar activities with North Korea and Iran. Pakistani officials have stated that they have no knowledge of the dealings, and that the materials were handled by criminals in the black market. Regardless, it is still hurting our public image."

 LibyaRandomEvents.8.d: "In an interview with the BBC, our Prime Minister stated that as we offered compensation to the victims of the Lockerbie Bombings, Libya had 'bought peace' but had not accepted guilt.

 LibyaRandomEvents.10.t: "Nurses Sentenced to Death"
 LibyaRandomEvents.10.d: "Five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor have been sentenced to death for intentionally infecting Libyan children with HIV. Several years ago, an HIV outbreak happened in a Benghazi children's hospital. According to the court, the nurses and doctor infected 426 children with the virus in order to research a possible cure. Of these children, 47 have already died. The defendants have continued to plead innocent to the case, stating that the outbreak was already in full swing when they arrived in the country and caused by poor hygiene in the hospital. They also state that they only gave their confessions after being tortured by the Libyan police.\n\nThe US and the EU have been pressuring Libya to overturn the decision, even going as far as asking [LBA.GetLeader] to intervene. However, the parents of the children are demanding the death sentence."

 LibyaRandomEvents.11.t: "Nurses Executed"

 LibyaRandomEvents.11.a: "Justice"
 LibyaRandomEvents.12.t: "Supreme Court Overturns Sentence"
 LibyaRandomEvents.12.d: "The Libyan Supreme Court has overturned the death sentence of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor. This ruling came just a few days before the execution was supposed to happen. Parents and relatives of the infected children stood outside the supreme court, protesting against the decision and calling for the death penalty to take effect. They are quite dissatisfied with the [LBA.GetLeader] inability to bring justice."
 LibyaRandomEvents.12.a: "Why can't the judges do what I tell them to do"
 LibyaRandomEvents.13.t: "A New Prime Minister?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.13.d: "With the international sanctions having been lifted, perhaps now is the time for another Prime Minister shuffle? A great candidate would be the current deputy Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi. Mahmudi has a medical degree and has previously been the Minister of Health and Social Security. He also has experience in other ministries. He has told us that if he were made Prime Minister, he would setup a Libyan Investment Authority that will take some of our oil profits and invest them for future generations."

 LibyaRandomEvents.15.c: "We haven't sent weapons to anyone"
 LibyaRandomEvents.16.t: "African Union Meeting"
 LibyaRandomEvents.16.d: "In a recent meeting of the African Union members, [LBA.GetLeader] did rounds discussing their plan for African unification with other leaders. There is still some resistance to the idea, as many African leaders worry that focusing on the union would reduce resources meant for solving various conflicts on the continent. In addition, many external reports show that the African Union even at its current state has several fiscal irregularities, which erodes trust in the Union."
 LibyaRandomEvents.16.a: "There were at least some with common ground"
 LibyaRandomEvents.16.b: "Africa is strong enough to deal with its own problems"

 LibyaRandomEvents.17.t: "[FRA.GetLeader] Visits Libya"
 LibyaRandomEvents.17.d: "The French President [FRA.GetLeader] has visited Libya in order to improve relations between the two countries.

 LibyaRandomEvents.19.t: "Libya Elected To UN Security Council"
 LibyaRandomEvents.19.d: "We have been elected to be a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the next two years. This is a great opportunity for us to improve the security of the world. However, this does come with some downsides. Non-permanent members usually see a 60% increase in foreign aid, and the economic growth of non-permanent members tends to half of non-members. Some might call this an attempt by the permanent members to influence our decision making."
 LibyaRandomEvents.19.a: "I guess a bit of extra money is nice"
 LibyaRandomEvents.19.b: "We won't give up our integrity for big countries"
 LibyaRandomEvents.20.t: "LIFG Base Raided"
 LibyaRandomEvents.20.d: "Our army has succesfully raided a hideout of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Roughly a dozen fighters were killed and none were left as prisoners.

 LibyaRandomEvents.20.b: "Burn the bodies, keep the guns"
 LibyaRandomEvents.21.t: "LIFG Raids Military Checkpoint"
 LibyaRandomEvents.21.d: "One of our military checkpoints has been raided by the LIFG. They charged the checkpoint with a handful of technicals, killing most of the guards there.

Reinforcements from a nearby barracks weren't fast enough to catch them."
 LibyaRandomEvents.21.a: "What coward runs from the enemy!?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.22.t: "LIFG Attacks Police Station"
 LibyaRandomEvents.22.d: "A police station in a major city has been attacked by the LIFG. They broke through the front door in the middle of the day, and a firefight ensued with the police officers, who were quickly overwhelmed. The LIFG fighters managed to hold their ground against a counter-attack by our army, while at the same time releasing captured LIFG members from the jail cells. Eventually, the LIFG withdrew from the police station under the cover of the night. While our army managed to kill some of the Islamists, we also suffered heavy casualties. With the release of LIFG fighters from jail, this was a net-positive attack for the LIFG."
 LibyaRandomEvents.22.a: "In the middle of the day!?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.23.t: "LIFG Occupies Military Base"
 LibyaRandomEvents.23.d: "One of our military bases was temporarily occupied by the LIFG. They started their attack by driving a truck loaded with explosives right to the main gate and blowing it up, causing confusion among our soldiers. Shortly after, LIFG fighters started pouring into the base from all directions. The chaos and panic caused most of our soldiers to abandon their positions and leave the base to the Islamists. Special forces were dispatched from another military base and after a few hours of siege, most of the Islamists had been killed while some managed to escape. Later, the LIFG sent out an announcement stating that this was only the beginning, and if the government does not relinquish power to them, they would target [ROOT.GetLeader] themselves."
 LibyaRandomEvents.23.a: "How can they occupy an entire military base?!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.24.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Assassinated"
 LibyaRandomEvents.24.d: "The worst imaginable has happened. The car convoy of [LBA.GetLeader] was suddenly attacked by a host of LIFG technicals. Boasting small arms and heavy weapons, the car of [ROOT.GetLeader] was peppered with bullets until taking a direct hit from RPG.

 LibyaRandomEvents.24.a: "This is awful"
 LibyaRandomEvents.25.t: "LIFG Fighters Return From Exile"
 LibyaRandomEvents.25.d: "With there officially being peace between the state and LIFG, many LIFG members who have been living in exile have returned to Libya."
 LibyaRandomEvents.25.a: "Nice, I guess?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.26.t: "Learning From Afghanistan Veterans"
 LibyaRandomEvents.26.d: "Many of LIFG members fought against the Soviet Union together with the Afghanistan Mujahideen. It would make sense we utilise their expertise whenever possible."
 LibyaRandomEvents.26.a: "What did you learn about army composition?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.26.b: "What did you learn about tactics?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.27.t: "Horrible Recruits"
 LibyaRandomEvents.27.d: "Many of LIFG members fought against the Soviet Union together with the Afghanistan Mujahideen. However, their fighting style and experience isn't exactly up-to bar on what is required from a modern military. Fanatic loyalty is good, but it can't always replace professionalism."
 LibyaRandomEvents.27.a: "I guess you get the good with the bad"
 LibyaRandomEvents.28.t: "The Theological Debate"
 LibyaRandomEvents.28.d: "Members of our ruling Salafist group had a heated argument about Islamic theology with members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

 LibyaRandomEvents.29.a: "Hah, women"
 LibyaRandomEvents.30.t: "Grand Mufti Issues Fatwa Against Enemies Of The State"
 LibyaRandomEvents.30.d: "The Grand Mufti has issued a fatwa against any enemies of our ruling party. He forbade any opposition from forming and stated that all of the state's enemies should be eliminated."

 LibyaRandomEvents.32.t: "Grand Mufti Greenlights Suicide Bombings"
 LibyaRandomEvents.32.d: "In a TV interview today, the Grand Mufti stated that suicide bombings are fully permitted by the Sharia Law. This has upset some of our citizens, as they are getting worried if they will be forced to martyr themselves to defend the states interests."

 LibyaRandomEvents.33.t: "Volunteer Jihadists"

 LibyaRandomEvents.35.d: "A union of teachers have organised a protest against the government's recent adoption of a curriculum that encourages the state's value. The teachers say that this hampers the ability for Libya to compete in a global world and the ability of young students to understand the world. Some teachers have even refused to teach the new curriculum and are sticking to the old one."
 LibyaRandomEvents.35.a: "We'll see what they teach when they are fired"
 LibyaRandomEvents.35.b: "Let them protest"
 LibyaRandomEvents.35.c: "Promise them some more freedom in education"
 LibyaRandomEvents.36.t: "Women Protest Against The Government"
 LibyaRandomEvents.36.d: "A women's organisation has organised a protest against the government. They are stating that the government's policies are against what the women of Libya stand for. Support for this protest is limited but it shows that not all women in the country agree with our policies, and they are not afraid to show it."
 LibyaRandomEvents.36.a: "Just ignore them"
 LibyaRandomEvents.37.t: "Women Support The Government"
 LibyaRandomEvents.37.d: "A women's organisation has organised a rally in support of the government. They have stated that the recent changes in policies towards women will not only improve the status of women in Libya, but will show the whole world how women should be treated."
 LibyaRandomEvents.37.a: "What brave women"
 LibyaRandomEvents.38.t: "Ba'athist Support From Abroad"
 LibyaRandomEvents.38.d: "Our Ba'athist policies are being welcomed with open arms abroad. A group of Ba'athist politicians from a foreign country hosted Libyan Ba'athist in a political meeting. This kind of networking is vital for Ba'athism to rise again."
 LibyaRandomEvents.38.a: "That's great!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.38.b: "Did they remember to network on LinkedIn as well?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.39.t: "Protests Against Ba'athism"
 LibyaRandomEvents.39.d: "A protest was organised near one of our embassies in a foreign country. The protestors were chanting anti-Ba'athist slogans, claiming our recent support for Ba'athism is simply an attempt to dominate other countries. These protests are hurting our attempts to unify all Arabs."
 LibyaRandomEvents.39.a: "Damn"
 LibyaRandomEvents.39.b: "Try to limit the damage"
 LibyaRandomEvents.40.t: "The Green Book - Book Club"
 LibyaRandomEvents.40.d: "The new Green Book written by Gaddafi is gaining traction. Since its release, it has become a number one seller. It can be commonly found in the backbags of students and it has even become popular outside of Libya."
 LibyaRandomEvents.40.a: "Good that people are reading"
 LibyaRandomEvents.41.t: "The Quran Club"
 LibyaRandomEvents.41.d: "The release of the new Green Book hasn't gone without resistance. In several cities, imams have setup book clubs where people can read and rehearse the Quran. It seems that people want to read something more traditional rather than guidelines from the state."
 LibyaRandomEvents.41.a: "The Green Book is better than the Quran"
 LibyaRandomEvents.42.t: "The Green Book - Book Club"
 LibyaRandomEvents.42.d: "Despite our attempts to get rid of Gaddafi's Green Book, the book is still finding its way to the hands of the people. Last night the police broke up a secret book club intended for fans of the book. It will be harder than planned to get people to read the Quran instead of the Green Book."
 LibyaRandomEvents.42.a: "Can we just get rid of that stupid book"
 LibyaRandomEvents.43.t: "The Quran Club"
 LibyaRandomEvents.43.d: "After we banned the Green Book, several imams set up reading clubs where young people can come and read the Quran together. This has created an increased interest in religious matters, and people are getting educated in Islam even without our intervention."
 LibyaRandomEvents.43.a: "Libyans are God's children after all"
 LibyaRandomEvents.44.t: "Dissident Discovered"
 LibyaRandomEvents.44.d: "An informant for the People's Revolutionary Committee notified the police of a possible dissident within the General People's Congress. The member was planning to put forward ideas of democracy and freedom of speech. Luckily this person was stopped before they could share their ideas."
 LibyaRandomEvents.44.a: "The state is safe once again"
 LibyaRandomEvents.44.b: "And we can thank the Revolutionary Committee for that"
 LibyaRandomEvents.45.t: "GPC Member Discusses Reforms"
 LibyaRandomEvents.45.d: "In a meeting of a General People's Congress today, a member made notion of possibly increasing citizen participation and opinion in the political process. How this dissident managed to hide his opinions from the People's Revolutionary Committee is not known, but ideas like these are dangereous to be spread around."
 LibyaRandomEvents.45.a: "How do we silence him?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.45.b: "Knock together some heads at the Revolutionary Committee"
 LibyaRandomEvents.46.t: "Revolutionary Discovered"
 LibyaRandomEvents.46.d: "Today the General People's Congress exposed a vocal revolutionary from the Revolutionary People's Committee. The member was ranting about how the GPC makes the state vulnerable to outside influences and a stronger hand is needed in ruling the country. Luckily, we managed to silence and deplatform him before any damage was done."
 LibyaRandomEvents.46.a: "Freedom has been guaranteed"
 LibyaRandomEvents.46.b: "And we can thank the General People's Congress for that"
 LibyaRandomEvents.47.t: "A Fiery Revolutionary"
 LibyaRandomEvents.47.d: "A member of the People's Revolutionary Committee has been making rounds in several conventions across the country stating how the General People's Congress are nothing but puppets of cabal powers. Preaching for the return of a security apparatus that protects the state and its people, the fiery revolutionary has been well reserved by many audiences."
 LibyaRandomEvents.47.a: "How do we silence him?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.47.b: "Knock together some heads at the General People's Congress"
 LibyaRandomEvents.48.t: "Senior Bureaucrat Stuck In The Past"
 LibyaRandomEvents.48.d: "Even though we have reformed our form of government, many officials, politicians and bureaucrats are still people who worked under the Gaddafi regime. One of these people has been recently complaining that the new regime is unyieldy, complicated and less efficient than the old one, and they are not very motivated to do their work efficiently anymore. Kicking them out would solve the problem but finding experience people like them is difficult. Alternatively, we could just 'promote' them to a more comfortable work assignment with better perks."
 LibyaRandomEvents.48.a: "Kick them out, we'll find a replacement"
 LibyaRandomEvents.48.b: "How about a pay raise and car allowance?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.49.t: "Old Politician Praises Government"
 LibyaRandomEvents.49.d: "Even though we have reformed our form of government, many officials, politicians and bureaucrats are still people who worked under the Gaddafi regime. One of the more senior politicans recently stated in a press conference that they are happy to see change in Libya. They said that they will do their utmost best to fix all the mistakes and bad legacy of the old regime."
 LibyaRandomEvents.49.a: "A true example of a patriotic politician"
 LibyaRandomEvents.49.b: "Do they have any old secrets to spill?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.50.t: "Royal Spending Spree"
 LibyaRandomEvents.50.d: "The state grants the Libyan royalty a small 'salary' that allows them to run their properties and feed their family. It seems that one member of the royal family went on a wide spending spree last weekend, blowing money on parties, boats, cars, property and harming several business ventures of the state."
 LibyaRandomEvents.50.a: "Maybe this monarchy thing wasn't such a good idea"
 LibyaRandomEvents.51.t: "Royal Investments"
 LibyaRandomEvents.51.d: "The state grants the Libyan royalty a small 'salary' that allows them to run their properties and feed their family. It seems that one member of the royal family has used some of that money to invest in a foreign country. This has greatly improved our standing within that country."
 LibyaRandomEvents.51.a: "A royal that is responsible with their money?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.52.t: "Confiscated Money Goes Missing"
 LibyaRandomEvents.52.d: "We have been steadily siphoning funds from the old royal family into the state's coffers. However, we recently noticed an abnormality in the books and it seems that a very large sum of confiscated money has ended in some official's pockets."
 LibyaRandomEvents.52.a: "Can you not trust anyone anymore?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.53.t: "Extra Money Found"
 LibyaRandomEvents.53.d: "We have been steadily siphoning funds from the old royal family into the state's coffers. We recently found a cache of valuables, high value art and bonds that will add more money into the coffers than projected."
 LibyaRandomEvents.53.a: "Show me the money!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.54.t: "Foreign Special Forces Kill Jihadist"
 LibyaRandomEvents.54.d: "Last night there was an armed incident in a small village in the Libyan desert. The village was government known hideout for a foreign terrorist who was temporarily in hiding in our country. Armed soldiers stormed the hideout, killing the terrorist and their guards. Based on the equipment and tactics used, it is clear this attack was conducted by a special forces unit of some kind. We have no idea which country these attackers originated from, how they got into the country or how they escaped. No country has taken responsibility of the attack so far. This is a clear violation of our sovereignty, and we could do nothing about it. It is only a matter of time until this news becomes known to the public and world."
 LibyaRandomEvents.54.a: "How is this possible? Were they ghosts?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.55.t: "Foreign Special Forces Repulsed"
 LibyaRandomEvents.55.d: "Last night there was an armed incident in a small village in the Libyan desert. The village was government known hideout for a foreign terrorist who was temporarily in hiding in our country. Armed soldiers stormed the hideout with the intention of killing the terrorists. However, the local seucrity forces managed to hold their ground against the attackers despite taking heavy casualties. The attackers vanished without trace or casualties. Based on the equipment and tactics used, it is clear this attack was conducted by a special forces unit of some kind. We have no idea which country these attackers originated from, how they got into the country or how they escaped. No country has taken responsibility of the attack so far. This is a clear violation of our sovereignty but at least we held our own, which hopefully will prevent further attacks. It is only a matter of time until this news becomes known to the public and world."
 LibyaRandomEvents.55.a: "At least we beat them back"
 LibyaRandomEvents.56.t: "Economic Ties Boost Growth"
 LibyaRandomEvents.56.d: "Our decision to tie our economy closer with Europe seems to be growing fruit. Increased investment and growth in Europe seems to be pulling us up as well. This is a good day for the economy."
 LibyaRandomEvents.56.a: "Money!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.57.t: "Economic Ties Decreases Growth"
 LibyaRandomEvents.57.d: "Our decision to tie our economy closer with Europe seems to have been not such a good idea. As the economies of Western countries slows down, it seems that our economy is suffering from ripple effects."
 LibyaRandomEvents.57.a: "Damn"
 LibyaRandomEvents.58.t: "Mercenaries Accused Of War Crimes"
 LibyaRandomEvents.58.d: "One of the mercenary groups we have sent abroad have been accused of war crimes. Locals report that they entered a village, looting it of its valuables and executing and raping several people. This story was quickly picked up by the global media and we are now under pressure."
 LibyaRandomEvents.58.a: "What mercenaries?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.59.t: "Mercenaries Bring Back Experience"
 LibyaRandomEvents.59.d: "One of the mercenary groups we have sent abroad has come back from their excursions. They were immediately advised to hold a workshop with our military officers in order to collect any experience they have gathered."
 LibyaRandomEvents.59.a: "What mercenaries?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.60.t: "Army Wants Its Equipment"
 LibyaRandomEvents.60.d: "In Libya, there are two armies; the Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular armed forces. The Guard Corps controls most of the supply dumps in the country. Recently, several high ranking army officers have complained that it is impossible for them to operate the army when most things have to be requested from the Guard Corps. They are demanding more supplies to be allocated to them."
 LibyaRandomEvents.60.a: "Give them their weapons"
 LibyaRandomEvents.60.b: "Those weapons are locked up for a reason"
 LibyaRandomEvents.61.t: "RGC Wants More Recruits"
 LibyaRandomEvents.61.d: "In Libya, there are two armies; the Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular armed forces. The balance of power has recently been shifted towards the regular armed forces. The Revolutionary Guards Corps has been complaining that ever since their importance was reduced, there has been a lack of recruits as most are being allocated to the army. They are finding it difficult to function by just trying to keep their existing manpower available."
 LibyaRandomEvents.61.a: "Assign some recruits to them"
 LibyaRandomEvents.61.b: "Sounds like a skill issue"
 LibyaRandomEvents.62.t: "Government Official Sells Oilfield"
 LibyaRandomEvents.62.d: "A curious document has made its way to [LBA.GetLeader]'s table. It shows that a government official has sold one of the state's oil fields to an international operator without any approval from the government or the National Oil Corporation. It seems that the money from the purchase has mostly gone to the pockets of this official."
 LibyaRandomEvents.62.a: "Nullify the purchase!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.62.b: "There's nothing we can do"
 LibyaRandomEvents.63.t: "NOC Drives Out Competition"
 LibyaRandomEvents.63.d: "A curious document has made its way to [LBA.GetLeader]'s table. The National Oil Corporation has used some political trickery to kick out a foreign corporation from one of Libya's oil fields. It seems that someone at NOC is trying to use the state's position to rack up more money for the company, and themselves."
 LibyaRandomEvents.63.a: "Nullify the purchase!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.63.b: "There's nothing we can do"
 LibyaRandomEvents.64.t: "Food Shortage"
 LibyaRandomEvents.64.d: "Due to our poor climate, we must import most of our food. This makes us very dependent on foreign countries, and disruptions without a steady supply line are common. Recently, there has been some problems with shipping grain to the country. With clogged ports not being able hold capacity and difficulty transporting grain accross the country, shortages have been created. This especially impacts the more rural areas, while the big cities of Tripoli and Benghazi are less affected. What should we do?"
 LibyaRandomEvents.64.a: "Try to acquire a quick food source"
 LibyaRandomEvents.64.b: "Let them eat cake!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.65.t: "Whistle Stop Tour"
 LibyaRandomEvents.65.d: "Now that we have a railroad in the country, it might sense to make the best of it and travel across the country on a political tour. We would be able to promote both the political establishment and the new railway at the same time."
 LibyaRandomEvents.65.a: "Chugga chugga chugga chugga choo choo!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.65.b: "Sounds a bit too Victorian for me"
 LibyaRandomEvents.66.t: "Train Derailed"
 LibyaRandomEvents.66.d: "It seems that our adoption of the train has not gone without a hitch. A train has been derailed. Dozens of passengers have been injured and several have died. People are calling our new trains death traps and claiming that our new rail project is just a vanity project for [LBA.GetLeader]."
 LibyaRandomEvents.66.a: "Promise to improve rail safety"
 LibyaRandomEvents.66.b: "These things happen!"
 LibyaRandomEvents.67.t: "Toubou Rebellion"
 LibyaRandomEvents.67.d: "Due to our weak internal political situation, the Toubou people living in Southern Libya have taken up arms in rebellion. Feeling disenfranchised by the govenment for years, they have finally had enough. Numerically, they are hopelessly outnumbered even with the few turncoats that have already left our military to join them. It should not be a large effort to crush this revolts, though it will detrack us from our main opponent."
 LibyaRandomEvents.67.a: "It is treason then"
 LibyaRandomEvents.67.b: "Let them be"
 LibyaRandomEvents.68.t: "Tuareg Rebellion"
 LibyaRandomEvents.68.d: "Due to our weak internal political situation, the Tuareg people living in Southwestern Libya have taken up arms in rebellion. Feeling disenfranchised by the govenment for years, they have finally had enough. Our military forces with Tuareg allegiances have already flipped to the Tuareg side, and hundreds of Tuareg tribesmen are moving over the border from Niger and Algeria to join the fight. This little rebellion might turn into something bigger if they are not stopped."
 LibyaRandomEvents.68.a: "It is treason then"
 LibyaRandomEvents.68.b: "Let them be"

 #Tribal events
 LibyaTribes.1.t: "Rising Star In The Army"
 LibyaTribes.1.d: "A [tribal_offender] officer in our army is showing great promise. They have quickly risen through the ranks though they now seem to have hit a wall regarding further promotions. It seems the military high brass has a personal interest in keeping this [tribal_offender] from getting any more power. We could intervene and force the military to give them another promotion. This move would also gather us some support from [tribal_offender] tribes. Alternatively, we could just silently accept the military's treatment of this young officer."
 LibyaTribes.1.a: "They deserve a promotion"
 LibyaTribes.1.b: "It is not our place to intervene"
 LibyaTribes.2.t: "Rising Star In The Navy"
 LibyaTribes.2.d: "A [tribal_offender] officer in our navy is showing great promise. They have quickly risen through the ranks though they now seem to have hit a wall regarding further promotions. It seems the military high brass has a personal interest in keeping this [tribal_offender] from getting any more power. We could intervene and force the military to give them another promotion. This move would also gather us some support from [tribal_offender] tribes. Alternatively, we could just silently accept the military's treatment of this young officer."
 LibyaTribes.2.a: "They deserve a promotion"
 LibyaTribes.2.b: "It is not our place to intervene"
 LibyaTribes.3.t: "Rising Star In The Air Force"
 LibyaTribes.3.d: "A [tribal_offender] officer in our air force is showing great promise. They have quickly risen through the ranks though they now seem to have hit a wall regarding further promotions. It seems the military high brass has a personal interest in keeping this [tribal_offender] from getting any more power. We could intervene and force the military to give them another promotion. This move would also gather us some support from [tribal_offender] tribes. Alternatively, we could just silently accept the military's treatment of this young officer."
 LibyaTribes.3.a: "They deserve a promotion"
 LibyaTribes.3.b: "It is not our place to intervene"
 LibyaTribes.4.t: "University Student Releases Thesis"
 LibyaTribes.4.d: "A [tribal_offender] student from a Libyan university has released a new thesis on some new technology. This thesis could help our industrial sector to advance. However, it does also reveal some critique of the ruling government and how the other tribes are holding Libya back. Should we suppress this thesis or let it be?"
 LibyaTribes.4.a: "This thesis is good news"
 LibyaTribes.4.b: "Suppress the publication"
 LibyaTribes.5.t: "Economist Offers Solution"
 LibyaTribes.5.d: "An economist from a [tribal_offender] tribe recently stated in a publication that Libya's economic productivity could be improved by cutting some taxes. By coincidence, these tax breaks would mainly impact economic sectors important to [tribal_offender] tribes. There is truth to what the economist is saying, but committing to the tax breaks would clearly make it look like we favour the [tribal_offender] tribes over the others."
 LibyaTribes.5.a: "The national economy comes first"
 LibyaTribes.5.b: "Let's try to keep the other tribes happy"
 LibyaTribes.6.t: "Local Politician Suggests Reform"
 LibyaTribes.6.d: "'When I was a little boy growing up in a [tribal_offender] village, things ran smoothly. Our elders knew how to run a community, something our government struggles doing', a local level [tribal_offender] politician stated on a TV interview recently when asked how he would improve the Libyan nation. In his interview, he made some good points how to modernise the nation. Adapting these changes would be beneficial but it would cause a slight loss of face."
 LibyaTribes.6.a: "I liked his ideas"
 LibyaTribes.6.b: "He should stick to his level"
 LibyaTribes.7.t: "Tribal Elders Suspected Of Treason"
 LibyaTribes.7.d: "An informant for the Revolutionary Committee from a [tribal_offender] tribe has shared information that two tribal elders have been discussing anti-revolutionary ideas with each other. Apparently, they have also been in contact with hostile powers, sharing sensitive information. We can't fully confirm all the details, but if true, these allegations are serious. Of course, it could be that this informant is simply trying to prop up the position of his own tribe."
 LibyaTribes.7.a: "Get rid of these two elders"
 LibyaTribes.7.b: "The informant is clearly lying"
 LibyaTribes.8.t: "A Large Donation"
 LibyaTribes.8.d: "A group of [tribal_offender] businessmen have approached the government. In exchange for the government considering some business friendly legislation, they are willing to donate a large sum of money to help the government run it's daily business. Looking at their suggestions on how to make Libya more 'business friendly', many items on their list include projects that would clearly only benefit [tribal_offender]s."
 LibyaTribes.8.a: "This sounds like a good deal"
 LibyaTribes.8.b: "This is corruption!"
 LibyaTribes.9.t: "Oil Company Occupying Tribal Land"
 LibyaTribes.9.d: "A group of [tribal_offender] elders have approached the government with a conundrum. An oil field run by a foreign corporation is operating on land belonging to their tribe. We can find any paperwork regarding the original ownership of the land, or if the land has been legally transferred to the oil company. However, we could probably use this as an excuse to get the oil fields back under government control if we wanted to, although a lot of the oil profits would then go to [tribal_offender]s."
 LibyaTribes.9.a: "Take back the field"
 LibyaTribes.9.b: "The company owns this field legally"
 LibyaTribes.10.t: "A Fiery Preacher"
 LibyaTribes.10.d: "An imam from a [tribal_offender] mosque claimed the superiority of [tribal_offender] traditions in a recent khutbah, stating that 'Out of all the people in Libya, [tribal_offender]s are the most loyal to Allah'. His speech has ruffled some feathers elsewhere in Libya and increased tensions between different tribes."
 LibyaTribes.10.a: "He is correct"
 LibyaTribes.10.b: "This preacher won't be preaching for long"
 LibyaTribes.11.t: "Abuse In The Military"
 LibyaTribes.11.d: "There has been a bit of a scandal in the military recently; a video of a [tribal_offender] officer abusing a group of [tribal_defender] recruits has been circulating online. The video shows the recruits being made to run around a track for hours in full gear, beaten with sticks and held underwater long periods of time. When asked about the incident, the [tribal_offender] officer stated that 'these gawad do not know how to act like soldiers. Ancient [tribal_offender] warriors with sticks and stones would make for a more effective modern military than these dogs'. Several [tribal_defender] elders have called for this officer to be kicked out of the military for tarnishing the name of Libya's armed forces."
 LibyaTribes.11.a: "The recruits are whining about nothing"
 LibyaTribes.11.b: "The officer clearly crossed the line"
 LibyaTribes.12.t: "Much Ado About Sheep"
 LibyaTribes.12.d: "Many of the Libyan tribes still engage in pastoral agriculture, herding their goats, sheep and cattle from one piece of land to another. A conflict arose between two tribes recently when [tribal_offender] pastorals crossed into [tribal_defender] territory. The [tribal_defender] tribe is demanding that the [tribal_offender] tribe pays compensation for damages, which apparently mostly includes all the grass that was eaten."
 LibyaTribes.12.a: "It's just grass?"
 LibyaTribes.12.b: "The tribal territories are sacred and should be respected"
 LibyaTribes.13.t: "Tribal Raid"
 LibyaTribes.13.d: "Last night, members of a [tribal_offender] tribe raided a [tribal_defender] farm claiming the farm is built on their land. They set the farm alight during the night, then returned in early morning to drive the inhabitants away. The elders of [tribal_defender] tribe are begging for the government to intervene and punish the [tribal_offender] raiders."
 LibyaTribes.13.a: "It was clearly [tribal_offender] land"
 LibyaTribes.13.b: "Raids? We live in a society"
 LibyaTribes.14.t: "Water Dispute"
 LibyaTribes.14.d: "The Great Man Made River provides free water to many Libyans. However, a [tribal_defender] tribe claims that members of a [tribal_offender] tribe are blocking [tribal_defender]s from accessing one of the water sources in of our bigger cities."
 LibyaTribes.14.a: "[tribal_defender]s have right to access that water"
 LibyaTribes.14.b: "[tribal_defender]s should drink on their own land"
 LibyaTribes.15.t: "Non-Representing Politician"
 LibyaTribes.15.d: "A bit of a scandal has happened in the local government of one of our small towns. A [tribal_offender] politican has been elected to lead the town, despite the town being majority [tribal_defender]. This has caused the people in the town to accuse the government of rigging the election to further [tribal_offender] agenda and are demanding that a [tribal_defender] politican be elected instead. We don't remember rigging any elections recently, but maybe it was the local branch?"
 LibyaTribes.15.a: "The elections were fair"
 LibyaTribes.15.b: "Give in to the townsfolk's demands"
 LibyaTribes.16.t: "Distribution Of Oil Money"
 LibyaTribes.16.d: "Two tribes are fighting over how the government distributes oil money. Members of a [tribal_offender] tribe are claiming that the government spends too much money improving the lives of [tribal_defender]s. Similarly, members of a [tribal_defender] tribe are claiming the exact opposite."
 LibyaTribes.16.a: "Give more money to the [tribal_offender]s"
 LibyaTribes.16.b: "[tribal_defender]s deserve extra money"
 LibyaFamily.1.t: "Family Casualty"
 LibyaFamily.1.d: "While military engineers were clearing up the damage from the recent British airstrike, they discovered something shocking. A badly burnt and mutilated body of one of Muammar Gaddafi's children was found among the rubble. It seems they had been inspecting the site without no one knowing, and they got caught in the attack."
 LibyaFamily.1.a: "How could this happen!?"
 LibyaFamily.2.t: "Internet Blackout"
 LibyaFamily.2.d: "Last weekend, an internet blog criticised the Gaddafi regime, specifically Muhammad Muammar Gaddafi. In response, in his role as head of the GPTC, Muhammad Gaddafi closed of the entire internet in the country for almost a week. While he was only trying to protect the regime, Muhammad's actions upset quite a lot of Libyans. Maybe someone so quick to anger should not be head of the GPTC after all?"
 LibyaFamily.2.a: "Nobody needs the internet"
 LibyaFamily.2.b: "Maybe we need a more competent replacement"
 LibyaFamily.3.t: "Fight Over Coke"
 LibyaFamily.3.d: "An adviser has disturbing news; there is a tense situation relating to Coke, and not the kind you are thinking of. Recently, Coca-Cola opened a bottling plant in Libya. Muhammad and Mutassim Gaddafi have both claimed ownership of the plant through their business ties, and this conflict has now escalated out of hand. Both Muhammad and Mutassim are now at the plant with their personal guards, armed to the teeth. There doesn't seem to be any signs of either side cooling down."
 LibyaFamily.3.a: "Intervene in favour of Muhammad"
 LibyaFamily.3.b: "Intervene in favour of Mutassim"
 LibyaFamily.3.c: "Is Pepsi okay?"
 LibyaFamily.4.t: "Muhammad Gaddafi Criticises His Father"
 LibyaFamily.4.d: "Muhammad Muammar Gaddafi has been living in exile for quite a while now. It seems that exile is weighing on him, as he recently mentioned in an interview how disappointed he is with his father. He stated that his father treats his people just like he treated Muammar; with neglect and unreasonable demands. While Muhammad holds very little influence in Libya thesedays, some Libyans have still expressed their sympathies towards him."
 LibyaFamily.4.a: "I thought he didn't care about politics?!"
 LibyaFamily.5.t: "Muhammad Rekindles His Passion For Politics"
 LibyaFamily.5.d: "After a brief discussion with his father, it seems that Muhammad has understood his position in the family. While initially reluctant to carry on his family's legacy, he has come to accept that one day he will be the leader of Libya. Gaddafi's succession is now a little bit more secure."
 LibyaFamily.5.a: "Good talk, son"
 LibyaFamily.6.t: "Muhammad Ignores His Father"
 LibyaFamily.6.d: "It seems that Muhammad is not willing to listen to his father. He does not want to follow in his father's footsteps in ruling the country, nor does he want to be like his father. After much shouting and many slammed doors, there seem to be no getting through to Muhammad. It seems for now Muammar has to be satisfied with the fact that his son is interested in at least some aspects of running the country, even if not as its leader."
 LibyaFamily.6.a: "How can I get through to him?"
 LibyaFamily.7.t: "Muhammad Leaves Libya"
 LibyaFamily.7.d: "After a heated argument about his responsibilites in ruling the country one day, Muhammad seems to have had enough of his father. Saying that he no longer feels like Libya is his home, he has decided to leave the country, at least for a little while. Hopping onto his private jet, he set course to Algeria with nobody knowing when he would be willing to return."
 LibyaFamily.7.a: "Come back home soon"
 LibyaFamily.8.t: "A Phenomenal Artshow"
 LibyaFamily.8.d: "Saif's artshow has been a success. Held in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts in Canada, the exhibition attracted the attention of multiple international corporations and Canadian citizens. Incidentally, while attending the show, Saif was able to organise several business meetings with multiple corporate representatives from companies such as Siemens, Petro-Canada and SNC-Lavalin. They had the chance to discuss multiple investment opportunities in Libya. While a personal success for Saif, this might even be a bigger success to Libya as a whole. We have the opportunity to deepen our cooperation with one of these large corporations."
 LibyaFamily.8.a: "Siemens is known for their electronics!"
 LibyaFamily.8.b: "As an oil nation, Petro-Canada is the natural partner"
 LibyaFamily.8.c: "To develop Libya, a construction company like SNC-Lavalin is the best"
 LibyaFamily.9.t: "A Decent Artshow"
 LibyaFamily.9.d: "Saif's artshow was hosted in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts. While the artshow managed to gather some interest, it didn't gather the attention we were aiming for. Many corporations pulled out of the sponsorship after public backlash. However, the exhibition did manage to gather the attention of the international public. At the very least, it managed to bring the attention of the world to Libyan culture, and Libya in general."
 LibyaFamily.9.a: "We can make art too"
 LibyaFamily.10.t: "An Art Disaster"
 LibyaFamily.10.d: "The artshow held in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts has been a total disaster. Many of the corporations pulled out of the sponsorhip after public backlash, and critics have described Saif's artwork as 'lurid' and 'a triumph of banality'. Eventually, the exhibition was torn down early as the Museum faced criticism of supporting the works of an artist who was so closely tied with the political regime of Libya. This has been a total humiliation for us."
 LibyaFamily.10.a: "Lurid? Don't they know art is subjective?"
 LibyaFamily.11.t: "Saif Accepts Position As Heir"
 LibyaFamily.11.d: "While initially hesitant to walk over his older brother's birthright, Saif eventually accepted his father's suggestion to be officially made his successor. As preparation for this role, Saif has been given more power within the regime."
 LibyaFamily.11.a: "I'm proud of you, son"
 LibyaFamily.12.t: "Saif Rejects Position As Heir"
 LibyaFamily.12.d: "Despite a lengthy discussion with his father, Saif has rejected any position of successor to his father. He said that if there is to be any succession, it is the birthright of his older brother Muhammad."
 LibyaFamily.12.a: "Maybe we can talk about this again later"
 LibyaFamily.13.t: "Saif Withdraws From His Father's Inner Circle"
 LibyaFamily.13.d: "Saif didn't take his father suggestions of him being his father's successor very well. Accusing his father of nepotism, Saif said that Libya 'was not a farm to inherit'. He said he had only taken a larger role in the country's administration due to the absence of institutions, not for personaly glory. He now said that he is no longer interested in helping his father run the country."
 LibyaFamily.13.a: "You were supposed to be the chosen one!"
 LibyaFamily.14.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Loses Court Case"
 LibyaFamily.14.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the British judges have convicted the Sunday Telegraph of libel. The articles the newspaper had published had provided no sources for their information, and the author was unable to show any evidence behind the allegations to the court. The court ruled that the articles were clearly intended to tarnish the name of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The newspaper was sentenced to pay monetary compensation to Saif al-Islam for damages to his reputation. They have also been required by the judges to publish an additional article where they apologise to Saif al-Islam. Saif al-Islam was spotted outside the courthouse showing the V-for-victory sign. As he was leaving, he told the press the first thing he would do is call his father who is most certainly going to be happy about the results."
 LibyaFamily.14.a: "Justice!"
 LibyaFamily.15.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Accepts Settlement"
 LibyaFamily.15.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the Sunday Telegraph and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi have agreed to settle the dispute. With help for the arbitration by a Saudi diplomat, the Sunday Telegraph accepted to pay some of Saif al-Islam's legal costs and issue a public apology without needing to pay for damages done to Saif al-Islam's reputation. Saif al-Islam was spotted outside the courthouse showing the V-for-victory sign. As he was leaving, he told the press the first thing he would do is call his father who is most certainly going to be happy about the results."
 LibyaFamily.15.a: "A fair compromise"
 LibyaFamily.16.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Wins Court Case"
 LibyaFamily.16.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the British judges have found the Sunday Telegraph innocent. While the newspaper provided no evidence for their allegations in the article itself, the author provided the evidence separately when requested by the court. While the evidence isn't enough to prove a solid connection between Saif al-Islam and money laundering, there are enough links to give justification to the article being written. This result has been a big reputation hit to Saif al-Islam, who quickly hurried out of the country on the same evening as the court case ended."
 LibyaFamily.16.a: "Nonsense. They are guilty!"
 LibyaFamily.17.t: "Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Wins Award"
 LibyaFamily.17.d: "The World Economic Forum (WEF) has awarded Saif al-Islam Gaddafi with the 'Young Global Leader' award. The award is intended for leaders who are strategic and inspiring with a deep commitment to creating lasting positive change within their societies and globally. This award will definitely strengthen Saif al-Islam's position in the government."
 LibyaFamily.17.a: "Very good!"
 LibyaFamily.18.t: "Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Received PhD"
 LibyaFamily.18.d: "Gaddafi's sone Saif al-Islam has been awarded a PhD from the London School of Economics. His thesis 'The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from soft power to collective decision making?' was examined by multiple well respected academics. However, the thesis has collected accusation of plagiarism, as well as allegations that the thesis was ghost-written by consultants from Monitor Group, a consulting firm which has earned more than $3 million in consulting fees from Saif's father."
 LibyaFamily.18.a: "There is no plagiarism!"
 LibyaFamily.19.t: "Saif al-Islam Calls For Reform"
 LibyaFamily.19.d: "Saif al-Islam has always been the most prodigous of Gaddafi's sons. Being educated in Europe with connections to multiple politicians, he is well versed in politics and diplomacy. However, he has always been an avid reformer. It seems he has now taken his steps of reform a bit further; in a recent interview, when asked what Libya needed most, he stated 'Democracy'. When asked to clarify if he meant that Libya needed more democracy, he was recorded saying 'No. 'More democracy' would imply that we had some'. He has also criticised Libya's human rights record, and has called for more reform in context of the current Jamahiriya system."
 LibyaFamily.19.a: "Democracy? Human rights? Has he gone insane?"
 LibyaFamily.20.t: "Saif al-Islam's Charity Work"
 LibyaFamily.20.d: "In 1998, Saif al-Islam founded a non-governmental organization called the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation (GICDF). The organization is known for dealing with hostage situation with Islamic militants as well as doing charity work in Sub-Saharan Africa. A recent charity drive has greatly increased our standing with one of our African brothers."
 LibyaFamily.20.a: "Great"
 LibyaFamily.21.t: "A Hunting Accident"
 LibyaFamily.21.d: "Saif al-Islam is a frequent visitor of the United Kingdom, including the royal family there. In a recent hunting trip on the estates of Princess Anne, Saif fell off his horse and accidentally discharged his weapon into his abdomen. He was hurried to the nearest hospital but died later of his wounds. The British government has already expressed their deepest condolences to Muammar Gaddafi and the Libyan nation, and have started to make preparations to get Saif's body back to Libya. This is a terrible blow to the Gaddafi family, as Saif al-Islam was on of the more prodigious children of Gaddafi."
 LibyaFamily.21.a: "Look what they did to my boy!"
 LibyaFamily.22.t: "Al-Saadi Finds Success"
 LibyaFamily.22.d: "After a large financial contribution by the Gaddafi family, the Italian Serie A team Perugia accepted Al-Saadi into their ranks. This deal turned out to be much better than what Perugia was excpecting. With Diego Maradona as his technical consultant and Ben Johnson as his personal trainer, Al-Saadi was well prepared for his next match. While he only played 20 minutes in his first match, Al-Saadi proved a positive surprise to all. Manager of Perugia told the [ROOT.GetLeader] that they were very happy that Al-Saadi was enrolled in the team. Al-Saadi seems to be on his way to becoming a real footballer."
 LibyaFamily.22.a: "I knew he had it in him!"
 LibyaFamily.23.t: "Al-Saadi Doesn't Get Picked"
 LibyaFamily.23.d: "We haven't found any teams that would be interested in taking Al-Saadi to their ranks. We were in dicussions with the Maltese Champions League level team Birkirkara F.C., but they withdrew from the negotiations when Al-Saadi tested positive for Nandrolone in a drug test. Al-Saadi's display of his footballing skill weren't impressing anyone either, with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica stating that 'even at twice his current speed he would still be twice as slow as slow itself'. Al-Saadi probably has to keep playing in Libya for now."
 LibyaFamily.23.a: "There's always next season..."
 LibyaFamily.24.t: "Al-Saadi Gets Carried Away"
 LibyaFamily.24.d: "We managed to find a proper European team for Al-Saadi to play in but not everything has gone according to plan. With his new access to Europe, Al-Saadi has worsened his drug habit even more. He barely plays any matches and wastes his time with parties and drugs, thinking he is a massive football star. He seems to be a lost cause now."
 LibyaFamily.24.a: "That's not how you play football"
 LibyaFamily.25.t: "The Football Riot"
 LibyaFamily.25.d: "It is well known in Libyan football circles that Al-Saadi Gaddafi has matches that he plays in fixed. In a recent game with his club Al Ahly, fans of the opposing club started booing him and his team and they paraded a donkey dressed in Al Ahly's colors in the pitch with the intention of protesting Al-Saadi's meddling in the matches. Al-Saadi didn't take this to his liking, and was heard shouting 'I will destroy your club! I will turn it into an owl's nest'. As a referee intervened and tried to calm the situation, the coach of Al Ahly shoved him aside. This caused the militant fans to get violent, storming the football pitch. Eventually, this turned into a full blown riot with security forces heavily cracking down on the rioters. The rest of the season has been cancelled in fears of further riots."
 LibyaFamily.25.a: "That vain idiot!"
 LibyaFamily.26.t: "Al-Saadi Overdoses"
 LibyaFamily.26.d: "Muammar Gaddafi's son, Al-Saadi, was found yesterday dead in a hotel room in Milan, Italy. It seems that he had died of drug overdose. Known for his drug abuse and extravagant lifestyle, this doesn't exactly come as a surprise. While a 'black sheep' of the Gaddafi family, he was still very dear to his father and siblings."
 LibyaFamily.26.a: "Should've sent him to rehab"
 LibyaFamily.27.t: "Al-Saadi Quits His Addiction"
 LibyaFamily.27.d: "It was a hard week for Al-Saadi. Spending all the time in isolation seems to have been worth it and he has managed to quit his addiction to drug. However, he did pickup a pretty heavy smoking habit in the process. Luckily, cigarettes aren't nearly as deadly as cocaine. Al-Saadi apologised to his father for his past behaviour and he has promised to do a better job in the future both for the sake of Libya and his family."
 LibyaFamily.27.a: "This is the only time I like quitters"
 LibyaFamily.28.t: "Al-Saadi Relapses"
 LibyaFamily.28.d: "The first week went well in rehab, and Al-Saadi managed to stay off his drug habit. However, on his second week he relapsed heavily. He eventually left the rehab center completely. The people at the center tried to prevent this, but Al-Saadi had called his personal bodyguard to pick him up and he threatened to kill everyone at the center if he was not let go. His drug habit seems to be stuck very hard."
 LibyaFamily.28.a: "I guess this is some kind of progress?"
 LibyaFamily.29.t: "Al-Saadi Bails Libya"
 LibyaFamily.29.d: "The first week went well in rehab, and Al-Saadi managed to stay off his drug habit. However, on his second week he relapsed heavily. He eventually tried to leave the center completely. The staff at the center tried to prevent this, but Al-Saadi set his personal bodyguards on the staff. This then escalated when local police was called to the scene. Al-Saadi then in a drug fueled panic freaked out, and escaped with his bodyguards to the Tripoli Airport, where he boarded his private jet and escaped to Switzerland. He hasn't been in contact with us since, and we are not sure if he is ever coming back."
 LibyaFamily.29.a: "Well that escalated quickly"
 LibyaFamily.30.t: "Al-Saadi Shames His Family"
 LibyaFamily.30.d: "Al-Saadi has been living in exile in Switzerland for a while now, hosting extravagant parties for celebrities and friends. A recent party didn't go exactly as planned, as Al-Saadi was found passed out on a beach naked with another naked man on top of him. This news quickly spread across tabloids, with Al-Saadi's exposed body being in magazine covers across Europe. This has certainly been a big hit to the Gaddafi family name."
 LibyaFamily.30.a: "On the beach?"
 LibyaFamily.31.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Oversteps His Boundaries"
 LibyaFamily.31.d: "It seems that Mutassim Gaddafi is still yearning to his military past. It was recently discovered that in his role as the National Security Advisor, Mutassim had requested $1.2 billion from the National Oil Corporation so he could form his own special forces brigade. This request was quickly denied and rejected by the government but Mutassim's abuse of his political position has not gone unnoticed."
 LibyaFamily.31.a: "Can he not let go of the past?"
 LibyaFamily.32.t: "Mutassim Finds A Good Deal"
 LibyaFamily.32.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, Mutassim has managed to get a large batch of state of the art equipment delivered for our armed forces. This will substantially improve our army's capacity."
 LibyaFamily.32.a: "What a great businessman!"
 LibyaFamily.33.t: "Mutassim Finds An OK Deal"
 LibyaFamily.33.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, Mutassim has managed to get a large batch of weapons for our armed forces. Unfortunately, it is all old stock from the Cold War that the [SOV.GetAdjective]s were planning to get rid of anyway. This won't improve our fighting capability but at least we have some extra stockpiles now."
 LibyaFamily.33.a: "Better than nothing I guess"
 LibyaFamily.34.t: "Mutassim's Deal Falls Through"
 LibyaFamily.34.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, nothing of notable was gained. The [SOV.GetAdjective]s weren't willing to hand out large amount of weapons to us. The visit to [SOV.GetName] has been a waste of time, and Mutassim's role as a National Security Advisor has now been tarnished."
 LibyaFamily.34.a: "Guess we better try again some time"
 LibyaFamily.35.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Extends Egyptian Influence"
 LibyaFamily.35.d: "Even though Mutassim Gaddafi is living in exile in Egypt, he still has connections with the Libyan regime, especially members of the General People's Committee. He has recently been in contact with many of his friends in Libya, and spoken highly of the Egyptian President [EGY.GetLeader]."
 LibyaFamily.35.a: "Is he planning a coup?"
 LibyaFamily.36.t: "Muhammad Gaddafi Leaves Libya For Good"
 LibyaFamily.36.d: "After yet another argument with his father, Muhammad Gaddafi has said that he would be leaving Libya for good. He says he no longer feels welcome at home, and just wants to live his life outside of politics. He has already prepared a trip to Algeria, though he did not say if he would make his new home there. It seems the eldest son of Gaddafi is out of the game."
 LibyaFamily.36.a: "Please don't go"
 LBA_muhammad_muammar_gaddafi_leaves_for_good_tt: "§YMuhammad Gaddafi§! is permanently exiled"
 LibyaFamily.37.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Murdered"
 LibyaFamily.37.d: "Mutassim Gaddafi has been found murdered in a hotel room in Amsterdam. The prime suspect in the case is the Libyan arms smuggler Tarek Kaituni. It seems that Mutassim, who frequented Amsterdam on 'business trips', was in reality having an affair with Lisa van Goinga, a Dutch model and wife of Kaituni. The Dutch police are yet to apprehend Tarek Kaituni, and his current location is unknown."
 LibyaFamily.37.a: "What?!"
 LibyaFamily.38.t: "Hannibal Gaddafi Arrested"
 LibyaFamily.38.d: "Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife have been arrested in Switzerland. Two of their servants had called the police claiming that the couple had attacked them in their hotel in Geneva. Two of Gaddafi's bodyguards were also arrested in the process as they tried to prevent the police from entering the Gaddafis' hotel room. Hannibal has a history with the police in Europe. Just a few years ago, a French court fined him for hitting his girlfriend, and only a year ago two of his bodyguards were arrested when the French police tried to prevent him from speeding. Hannibal was released on a bail of 124 000 euros and his wife for 186 000 euros. This has sparked a diplomatic incident between Switzerland and Libya."
 LibyaFamily.38.a: "Switzerland isn't even a real country!"
 LibyaFamily.39.t: "Hannibal Gaddafi Drowns"
 LibyaFamily.39.d: "Due to his education and occupation, Hannibal Gaddafi frequently boards and works on various naval vessels of the General National Maritime Transport Company, the state owned trading company. An accident happened today when in stormy weather Hannibal went overboard. The crew of the ship did their best trying to save him but they were unable to pull him back up to the ship. Eventually Hannibal disappeared beneath the waves, never to be seen again."
 LibyaFamily.39.a: "They should've tried harder!"
 LibyaFamily.40.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Appointed UN Goodwill Ambassador"
 LibyaFamily.40.d: "At a a ceremony at Watassemo Charity Association headquarters in Tripoli, Aisha Gaddafi, was appointed as United Nations Development Program National Goodwill Ambassador for Libya due to her past charity work. In her new role as UN Goodwill Ambassador, she will work together with the UNDP to raise awareness on issues related to Millennium Development Goals, advocate for women's rights, work on combating the spread of HIV/AIDs and promote UNDP's work in Libya. This is a tremendous occasion as as we repair our relations with the world."
 LibyaFamily.40.a: "Good for her!"
 LibyaFamily.41.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Discovers Her Hidden Power"
 LibyaFamily.41.d: "We are not quite sure what happened with Ayesha's military training, but it has been miraculous. She just startted commanding troops and in our latest war games she even beat our top military generals. Some of our soldiers have started calling her the 'Amazon of Libya', named after the ancient warriors on Muammar Gaddafi's all-female personal bodyguard. Her military prowess has encouraged many more women to flock to recruiting centers in the hopes of becoming like her."
 LibyaFamily.41.a: "Girlpower!"
 LibyaFamily.42.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Promoted To General"
 LibyaFamily.42.d: "Ayesha has finished her training to become a general. While she hasn't been particularly talented in the training, she did have some unique ideas we might be able to utilise later. She has stated that she won't be taking an active role in the military but rather keep her rank of general as ceremonial."
 LibyaFamily.42.a: "It's something"
 LibyaFamily.43.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Fumbles Her Military Training"
 LibyaFamily.43.d: "Ayesha's military training hasn't gone exactly to plan. First she managed to get an entire brigade lost, then in a wargame she had them attacking in the wrong direction. Her stubborn personality has also caused several clashes with many senior military officials, even causing one of them to resign from the military. She eventually did make it to the rank of general. However, she won't be actively serving in the military. Despite this, the total failure of her training has caused our entire military education and army become subject to ridicule and suspicion."
 LibyaFamily.43.a: "How can you fail that bad?"
 LibyaFamily.44.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Defends Women's Rights"
 LibyaFamily.44.d: "In a recent interview, Ayesha Gaddafi publically criticised the status of women in Libya. She stated that they are oppressed in the country and not given the same opportunities as men. She especially called out [ROOT.GetLeader], pointing out to their all-female group of bodyguards. While on the surface this seems like it empowers women, in reality it simply objectifies women as the bodyguards are usually chosen by their looks and not by their military skill. This interview has caused quite a stir in Libya, and there have already been several demonstrations for women's rights."
 LibyaFamily.44.a: "Women in Libya have it just as good as the men!"
 LibyaFamily.45.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Dies In Childbirth"
 LibyaFamily.45.d: "There are tragic news about the only daughter of Muammar Gaddafi. Last night, after her fourth child had been born, Ayesha died of postpartum bleeding. The doctors tried their best to stop the bleeding but nothing could be done. Luckily, the child was born healthy but this is still a tragic loss for the Gaddafi family."
 LibyaFamily.45.a: "The doctors should've done better!"
 LibyaFamily.46.t: "Saif al-Arab Suspected Of Acid Attack"
 LibyaFamily.46.d: "Saif al-Arab is a frequent visitor of Germany. Recently, he got into trouble at a nightclub in Munich. As his girlfriends started stripping on the dancefloor, the bouncer of the club threw him and his girlfriend out of the club. A brawl broke out between Saif and the bouncer. Later, he came under investigation by the German police of allegedly planning an acid attack against the bouncer as retaliation. Saif has obviously denied these claims."
 LibyaFamily.46.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.46.b: "Send him legal help!"
 LibyaFamily.47.t: "Saif al-Arab Suspected Of Arms Smuggling"
 LibyaFamily.47.d: "The German prosecutors office is charging Saif al-Arab with arms smuggling. Apparently, they have evidence that Saif helped smuggle a bag of assault rifles, a revolver and ammunition from Munich to Paris. This is a very serious claim."
 LibyaFamily.47.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.47.b: "Put some diplomatic pressure on the Germans!"
 LibyaFamily.48.t: "Saif al-Arab's Ferrari Impounded"
 LibyaFamily.48.d: "The German police has impounded Saif al-Arab's Ferrari after neighbours complained about the loud noise its exhaust was making. Saif al-Arab is now facing charges under breach of peace."
 LibyaFamily.48.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.48.b: "Send him legal help!"
 LibyaFamily.49.t: "Saif al-Arab Dies In Prison"
 LibyaFamily.49.d: "While Saif al-Arab was convicted of crimes in Germany, he managed to evade a prison sentence by returning to Libya. However, for reasons unknown, he was again visiting Germany. The German police managed to capture him and he was taken to a local jail in Munich. The following day, he was found hanged in his cell. The official statement from the German police is that this was a suicide, with the most likely motivation being the shame Saif caused to his family. However, there are alternative theories of a possible revenge by fellow inmates or even a staged suicide by the German intelligence service."
 LibyaFamily.49.a: "Saif al-Arab didn't kill himself!"
 LibyaFamily.50.t: "Khamis Gaddafi Turns 18"
 LibyaFamily.50.d: "Today was the birthday of Khamis Gaddafi, Muammar Gaddafi's youngest son. He has finally turned 18 and is now ready to start taking a bigger role in the Libyan government."

 LibyaFamily.51.a: "Oh no"
 LibyaFamily.52.t: "Rebels Kill Family Member"
 LibyaFamily.52.d: "With the loss of territory to more rebels, a member of the Gaddafi family got caught in the crossfire. Captured in a command center by rebel militias, one of Muammar Gaddafi's children was severely beaten and killed by the rebels."
 LibyaFamily.52.a: "We will avenge them!"
 LibyaFamily.53.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Humiliates The UN"
 LibyaFamily.53.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. It took him 17 minutes before he got to his main point, calling for an African seat at the Security Council. Waving a copy of the UN charter, he denounced the permanent setup of the Security Council which he said encouraged the treatment of other countries as 'second-class citizens'.\n\n'It is political feudalism for those who have a permanent seat...It should not be called the Security Council, it should be called the terror council. It did not provide us with security but with terror and sanctions,' he said as he ripped a page out of the charter in a show of defiance.\n\n'Permanent is something for God only. We are not fools to give the power of veto to great powers so they can use us and treat us as second-class citizens...Veto power should be annulled,' he added before tossing the UN charter over his shoulder. He also demanded the UN headquarters to be moved to Libya, a thorough investigation to the death of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King, proposed that Israel and Palestine should be combined into Isratine, celebrated the Taliban, spread conspiracies about the Swine Flu and demanded 7.7 trillion dollars as reparations to Africa for colonialism. Overall, it took him full 90 minutes before ending his speech, when speeches usually last only about 15 minutes.\n\nOur great leader has shown the World that Libya is its true master!"
 LibyaFamily.53.a: "That sure showed them!"
 LibyaFamily.54.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Gets Through His Speech"
 LibyaFamily.54.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. He rambled on for a short time about how the Security Council should have a seat dedicated for Africa, while at the same time going on tangents about colonialism, Swine Flu and Israel. He seemed to be profusely sweating as he tried to get through his lines, trying to stay on topic. After 20 minutes, he was asked to stop the speech, which he did. Somewhat reluctantly Muammar Gaddafi walked down from the podium, seemingly mumbling about how this was 'another example of the West trying to silence the rise of Africa'. It definitely was a speech, but it probably didn't have the effect Gaddafi was hoping for."
 LibyaFamily.54.a: "Gaddafi needs to work on his charisma"
 LibyaFamily.55.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Kicked Off The Podium"
 LibyaFamily.55.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. He startled rambling about Zionism, calling the Security Council a terrorist organisation funded by Israel. He also mocked his fellow Arab leaders, calling them toys of the British. It wasn't long until a wave of booing began at the Assembly, with delegates calling for Gaddafi to stop his speech. Gaddafi, in response, called all the delegates idiots, and even threw a bottle of water towards the Israeli delegation. Shortly after this, the security dragged him off the podium, followed by cheers from the Assembly. As he was being dragged off, he was heard yelling 'Why are you booing me? I'm right!'. This has been a total disaster for Libya's image."
 LibyaFamily.55.a: "That did not go as planned"
 LibyaFamily.56.t: "People Understand Gaddafi's Message"
 LibyaFamily.56.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, but oddly enough many of them refused. It seems they understood Gaddafi's message that one shouldn't rely on handouts. After the event, we have noticed an increase in the amount of overtime people spend at their work, and food banks are reporting a decrease in people. It seems that all the people needed was a little kick in the back."
 LibyaFamily.56.a: "Libyans are a hard working people"
 LibyaFamily.57.t: "People Miss Gaddafi's Point"
 LibyaFamily.57.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, and started hoarding the money. As soon as the street was cleaned out, people continued with their daily business. The message from the loudspeakers fell on deaf ears, as people just wanted to make a quick buck. At the very least, people will be a bit happier with the regime."
 LibyaFamily.57.a: "I guess this is a good thing?"
 LibyaFamily.58.t: "People Misunderstand Gaddafi's Message"
 LibyaFamily.58.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, and started hoarding the money. As soon as one part of the street was cleaned out, people continued following the motorcade in the hopes of more money. Ultimately thousands of people were walking behind the line of vehicles, collecting every coin they could find. Even more surprisingly, people came out even the following day, waiting for the non-existing motorcade to arrive again. A similar trend was noticed in some other Libyan cities as well. People know seem to expect that the government just hands them out money, and they have become considerably less motivated to work."
 LibyaFamily.58.a: "Didn't they understand it was an allegory? Or maybe it was a metaphor?"
 LibyaFamily.59.t: "The Car Is A Good Design"
 LibyaFamily.59.d: "After Muammar Gaddafi shared his ideas with Libyan engineers and consultants from European car manufacturers, the listeners congratulated the leader on his keen design sense. They were sure that Gaddafi's ideas could be implemented in practice succesfully. However, not all of the ideas could be used in a single vehicles. What should be the main focus? Should we make a car that is sturdy and safe, a car that is made cheaply and meant for mass production for the people or a truck that can be used for military applications when needed.

However, the production of the car went forward anyway. Shortly after at a car show in Libya, the Saroukh el-Jamahiriya (Libyan Rocket) was unveiled. Packed with a bunch of safety features, Gaddafi has dubbed the car the safest in the world. However, all of the safety features on the car are standard elements of any modern car. What is non-standard however, is the car's shape; both the front and rear bumpers are shaped like a wedge. The idea is that on collision, the car will simply be deflected away from anything it hits. While turning a car into a pinball might not be safest road element, this might have some military uses."

However, the production of the car went forward anyway. Shortly after at a car show in Libya, the Saroukh el-Jamahiriya (Libyan Rocket) was unveiled. Dubbed by Gaddafi as the safest car in the world, the show continued with a live presentation of the car's unique wedge shape which would simply deflect anything the car collides with. As the car sped of on the test track, it ricocheted off the impact straight into the watching audience. As the car hit the safety barrier, it exploded in a ball of fire. Several people died due to the collision, and dozens were injured. Immediately after, there was a sudden drop in all new car sales the following week. People are refusing to buy new cars as they fear for their safety. If the safest new car is this unsafe, how bad are the others? People are even importing older cars from Cental Africa to get their hands on something old and reliable. This increase in old cars on the roads has actually worsened Libya's traffic accidents and fatalities."

While originally, it was planned for Gaddafi to meet [?libya_state_visit_target.GetName]'s leader in a more official setting, eventually [?ibya_state_visit_target.GetLeader] caved in to Gaddafi's demands to have the meeting in his tent.

The local authorities however disallowed the tent from being raised however, and Gaddafi was guided to a local hotel. Gaddafi refused to do so, demanding that it is customary to his people to hold meeting in a tent. The person he was suppose to be meeting, [?libya_state_visit_target.GetLeader], eventually cancelled all meetings as Gaddafi refused to budge his stance. This trip has been worthless and the world has seen that the 'Mad Dog' of Libya seems to be completely toothless."

 LibyaFamily.65.t: "A Powerful Ritual"
 LibyaFamily.65.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi had gathered some of his elite troops in a courtyard in Tripoli, a Senegalese Marabou took position in front of the troops. Writing incantations and strange symbols on a piece of paper, the paper was covered with dried lion's skin, plants that grow in cemeteries and bark from a tree where a man had died. Wrapping everything together in a neat package, the offering was put on hot red coals to slowly burn and smoke. The Libyan soldiers were ordered to walk one by one over the smoke, allowing the smoke to penetrate their vitality. Shortly after, the Marabou started invoking the spirits to give strength to the soldier. In a trance like state, the soldiers started repeating 'God...Libya...Gaddafi'. As the ritual was over, the soldiers were bloodthirsty, vigorous and ready to fight until their last breath. Libya is saved!"

However, nobody stepped forward. The soldiers started calling the Marabou a heathen, saying that such calling upon of the Jinn was heretical and against Islam. The whole situation quickly got out of hand, with Gaddafi and the Marabou both having to escape the courtyard in panic from the wrath of the angry soldiers. Many of the soldiers dropped their uniforms and deserted right there. Word of the ritual quickly spread across the military, and our soldiers have begun losing faith in our leader left and right."

 LibyaFamily.68.d: "Gaddafi had decided to organise his lecture in Rome, while he was visiting Italy.

The women were advised to not wear miniskirts or plunging necklines due to the piosity of the event. When the women were gathered in the lecture hall, Gaddafi arrived clad in all black, and begun his lecture. Gaddafi's all-female staff handed out copies of the Koran to the women, while Gaddafi himself lectured on Islam, the failure of Christianity and the role of women in the West. Gaddafi's words seemed to resonate with a lot of the women, as directly after the lecture several women alreadyd told him they'd like to convert to Islam.
