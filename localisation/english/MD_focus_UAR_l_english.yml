 form_UAR_category: "The Arab Unification"
 form_UAR_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\n£LBA_desctext_federation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the early 1900s, some people have had a dream of uniting the Arabs under a single state. None have been so strong in the idea than the Ba'athists, supporters of an anti-colonial Arab socialist and nationalist movement. Several attempts were made to unite various Arab countries during the Cold War, but all of these failed due to political disagreements. Today, the Ba'athist movement is separated into two camps; a pro-Syrian (neo-Ba'athist) faction and a pro-Iraqi faction."
