###Political Events
post_united_event.1.t: "Factionalism Fractures Free States"
post_united_event.1.d: "In the hasty wake of the sembelance of society known as the Free States of America, the presiding federal government of this rump nation has developed a series of strong factionalism. This factionalism is split into what many see as four groups. These groups consist of the Socialist in the North, Militarist in the East, Monarchist in the South and the Central/West are the Federalists. These factions have consolidated into two main factions, more to come as we find new details."
post_united_event.1.o1: "Didn't We Divide Ourselves Enough?"
post_united_event.2.t: "The Pro Election Group"
post_united_event.2.d: "In the rising political factionalism of recent we've seen the rise of pro-election groups like the Federalist Party, Free Socialist Party and the Modern Monarchism Party. These parties while different in end goals and essentially anything cohesive have all somehow agreed on the principle of elections. Understanding that the voting system being as representative as feasible given the current state of things. Many still cling to the hope that voting for the future will unite us more in the long run than divide us, but only time can tell that."
post_united_event.2.o1: "Let's Vote For The Future We Want"
post_united_event.3.t: "The Anti-Election Group"
post_united_event.3.d: "On the other hand we have the anti-election parties, these consisting of the Federalist Party, Free Socialist Party and the United Services Party. As one can tell the factionalism which divdes the two main parties, the Federalist and Free Socialist seem to fundamentally split the potential future tickets if elections were to be held. Though we know little on the state of these divisions, we'll see what may come of things in the coming days as the debate continues on."
post_united_event.3.o1: "We Need To Focus, Not Debate."
post_united_event.4.t: "The Divisive Poll"
post_united_event.4.d: "In the past couple of weeks pollsters and journalist have been sweeping the nation as in a sort of psudeo voting scheme that is the \"National Poll\" has seen many divided over what direction we should really be taking. In the end many agreed that elections further more at this time are only to serve as a distraction in the weakened and crippled state we find ourselves in. Now its up to the four main parties to sway the public opinion for their favor. The Federalist Party and their more Conservative faction, the Free Socialist Party's Statist faction, the Mid-Atlantic Party's Isolationist faction or the National Service Party's Militarist faction. All want different things, but all want the same thing as well. No elections and a more self sufficient identity for the foreseeable future."

As such the Federalist, Free Socialist, Mid-Atlantic and National Service Parties all are seeking the public support to gain a secured majority in the election. But as the time wears on and the votes are tallied up the winner of the first official elections is..."

post_united_event.1000.t: "The Great Question"
post_united_event.1000.d: "With the winds changing in our hopeful favor, we took a national grand standing gesture and proclaimed a potential name change for the nation. As such a national vote was organized and as such the results will soon be tallied. The great gamble is at hand and we will see what the people truly want...lets just hope its us they want."

post_united_event.1000.o2: "At Least We Are United...Right?"
post_united_event.2000.t: "The Capital Crisis"
post_united_event.2000.d: "Following the 2nd Manifest Destiny, the eyes and ears of the nation's people turn to the capital, of which is still in the old east coast hovel. Many believe that the capital shouldn't change cause of its symbolism, where as many more believe it should change to symbolize the change of the nation as a whole. A new capital would allow for better pre-planning in terms of growing the House of Representatives, something many believe to be one of the main faults of the old order's political quagmiring. Plus a new capital would likely be more central, giving light, attention and exposure to people who would have never dreamed of even considering whatever the federal government does. Nevertheless several candidates are up for choice and its up to the people and their leaders to make the choice."
post_united_event.2000.o1: "Why Change, Things Are Fine."
post_united_event.2001.t: "The Rockies"
post_united_event.2001.d: "Many argue the creation of a capital region near or practically on the Rocky Mountains. This would create a natural fort like apparatus if and whenever our nation should come under assault. Others argue that it could be seen as a bit more isolating then it was intended to be. Regardless planners have already started laying the ground work for some kind of settlement in the north of Colorado"
post_united_event.2001.o1: "Do We Get Rocky Road For Cheap?"
post_united_event.2002.t: "The \"Central\" Government"
post_united_event.2002.d: "Kansas planners argue that where they are proposing a new capital location is one of the most centrally located suggestions. This would be seen as fair and not catering to a pro-east coast vs west coast kind of mentality. Nevertheless we'll have to evaluate the rest of our options to assure the validity of our choice."
post_united_event.2002.o1: "They Got A Point Though."
post_united_event.2003.t: "The River Barrier Option"
post_united_event.2003.d: "Many in recent days have seen it more feasible to have the capital near the Mississippi river, a large and dedicated barrier from enemy ground assaults. A symbol of the supposed continental divide of our nation and a position more secure when you consider the somewhat vertical river that would cover its southern flank while its east and almost north was covered as well. The option is more eastern then the other two option, but its situated on the western side of the Mississippi. Regardless there is still the planning of what the new building will look like as well as what do we plan on doing with the House of Representatives."
post_united_event.2003.o1: "Plenty Of Water At Least."
post_united_event.2004.t: "The Final Decision"
post_united_event.2004.d: "After weeks of deliberation and planning, the polls from the public and many others facets of the situation. It is finally time to decide where the new capital and its name will be. In Colorado there is the proposition of Mount Columbia, In Missouri we have the town of Winfield being used as the base with its surroundings of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers for natural borders. Finally we have the proposition of New Arlington in the north of Kansas, spacious, open and more or less empty, it would be a likely blank canvas for which to develop."

There will obviously be inefficiencies cause there is just so much to have a command and control over, nevertheless we will prevail. The Eagle fell, but she rose once more to soar ever higher before."
