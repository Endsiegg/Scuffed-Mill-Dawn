 AFRICA_idea_tuareg_rebellion: "Tuareg Rebellion"
 AFRICA_idea_tuareg_rebellion_desc: "The Tuareg people are in open revolt against our country. The resource-rich areas that border the Sahara are particularly impacted by the fighting amongst the Tuaregs and the government."
 kamajors: "Kamajors"
 kamajors_desc: "The Kamajors were a Mende militia operating in Sierra Leone during its civil war. The group was originally formed to serve as a militia to protect villages from the RUF rebels. However, they were known for fighting the government's troops as well, to protect villages from looting army soldiers."
 blood_diamond_trade: "Blood Diamond Trade"
 blood_diamond_trade_desc: "The main source of income for both the Government forces as well as the rebel groups are diamonds, as it is the only currency that holds value in the country. Often dug up through slave labour, the diamonds are smuggled across the border and then sold forward as legally acquired diamonds. Since the diamonds are only used to fuel the conflict, the local population doesn't get the benefits of its riches."
 blood_diamond_trade_idea_TT: "Additional Income: $§G0.040§!"
 CAR_central_bush_republic_war_idea: "Central African Republic Bush War"
 CAR_central_bush_republic_war_idea_desc: "The Central African Republic Bush War is a low-level conflict with fighting in the northern parts of the country between local forces.

 # Ivory Coast
 ivory_coast_md.1.t: "Promise of Elections"
 ivory_coast_md.1.d: "On the 24 December 1999 former president Henri Konan Bédié was deposed in a military coup. Since then the Ivory Coast has been run by the National Public Salvation Committee, a military junta. Many Ivorians welcomed the coup, saying that they hoped the army would improve Ivory Coast's shaky economic and political circumstances, but now there is pressure for a return to civilian rule. The question is whether we should permit migrant workers, who make up most of the north's population to stand for election"
 ivory_coast_md.1.o1: "Only allow natural citizens."
 ivory_coast_md.1.o2: "Allow all migrant candidates."
 ivory_coast_md.1.o3: "Continue the Junta."

 ivory_coast_md.2.t: "Escalating Violence"
 ivory_coast_md.2.d: "After the elections, there has been significant conflict between migrant workers and locals. The allowance of migrant candidates may have helped, but the country is still ruled by a distinctly southern government."

 ivory_coast_md.3.t: "Protests in the North"
 ivory_coast_md.3.d: "After the elections, there have been several escalating protests across the north of the country. Migrant workers are complaining at their lack of representation."

 ivory_coast_md.4.d: "There have been large-scale protests headed by the Ivorian Popular Front and Patriotic Movement in the south and north of the country respectively. They are calling for an end to our military dictatorship and a return to civilian rule, although nobody seems to agree on who should rule the country."
 ivory_coast_md.4.o1: "This is unacceptable, send in the military!"
 ivory_coast_md.4.o2: "Concede power to the Ivorian Popular Front."

 ivory_coast_md.5.t: "Rebellion in the North"
 ivory_coast_md.5.d: "The protests have escalated with elements of the military defecting and declaring a rival government. Their forces control the majority of the north. They have so far made no attempts to invade the south."

 ivory_coast_md.5.o2: "Now is not the time for war."
 ivory_coast_md.5.o3: "The FNC is Correct Option"

 ivory_coast_md.6.t: "Rebellion in the North"
 ivory_coast_md.6.d: "The protests have escalated with elements of the military defecting and declaring a rival government. Our country has now been plunged into civil war. The FNC have declared their secession in the north citing a multitude of reasons such as unfair treatment and a lack of say in the government in the south. Brother and sister alike have now taken up arms against each other as every person must now choose a side in the brewing conflict. The First Ivorian Civil War has begun."

 ivory_coast_md.8.t: "Government Quells Protests"
 ivory_coast_md.8.d: "Ivorian authorities have been largely successful in their quashing of protests in the region. Support from the military and the efforts from the police forces. The situation with the protesters continues to remain volatile. It remains to be seen whether our forceful disruption of the protest will ultimately spell additional issues, but they have been stopped for now."
 ivory_coast_md.8.o1: "Eh, It's Probably Fine..."

 ivory_coast_md.9.t: "Violence Dies Down"

 ivory_coast_md.11.d: "Our nation has yet to have had an election since Laurent Gbagbo took power in 2000. The tumultuous First Ivorian Civil War gave way to the lack of elections and the tense peace between supporters of Gbagbo and the supporters of the FNC and the opposition parties. It is clear that leading into this election Gbagbo is trailing behind his opponent Alassane Ouattara. Should we allow the peaceful transition of power? Is it time to nullify the results of this election?"

 ivory_coast_md.12.t: "Alassane Ouattara States Foulplay"
 ivory_coast_md.12.d: "Alassane Ouattara and their party the RDR have cited the elections have been tampered with and that Ouattara is the true winner of the election.

The military forces in the region have started to turn from active conflict to more of peacekeeping while the fighting dies down. People are talking in hushed tones and the former enemies that we were fighting have either been driven out of the country or they are currently lying in wait. We, however, are beginning a new day as we start our transition into a peace time government. There will be peace in our time and [CDI.GetLeader] will be the one to lead us forward."

However, recent polling has shown that we are likely to lose the 2000 presidential election to the opposition coalition led by Abdoulaye Wade. The coalition consists of the [liberalism_L], [Western_Autocracy_L], [conservatism_L], and [socialism_L] parties that have banded together to defeat the [neutral_Social_L]. Their combined opposition strength ([?opposition_strength|Y2%]) compared to the [neutral_Social_L] ([?party_pop_array^18|Y2%]) is landing the opposition firmly in the lead. How should we proceed heading into these elections?"
 senegal_md.1.o1: "Let the elections proceed like normal."

For the time being, we should remain cautious but continue to monitor the situation for any more of these upstarts..."

Pastoralist communities and our other nomadic communities are hit particularly hard by this drought. The drought comes after a period of no rain in the Sahel causing otherwise lush areas ideal for the pastoralist communities to be sparsely vegetated and agricultural works in the Sub-Sahara cause a great amount of suffering in the region."
