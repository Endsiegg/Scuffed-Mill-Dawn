SRA_idea_isolationist_focused_foreign_office: "Anti-Foreign Policy Dominance"
SRA_idea_isolationist_focused_foreign_office_desc: "With the state of our nation and its sudden and volatile \"birth\", many within the government as well as the general public don't even consider a foreign policy, let alone what it should be. For now the foreign office is seen more as a stand in to help stack the government rather than a real appointment."
SRA_idea_neighborhood_foreign_policy: "Limited Foreign Policy Program"
SRA_idea_neighborhood_foreign_policy_desc: "Through the development of our fair nation as well as the change in the public perception of our grand Southern nation. We shall now seek to open our eyes to beyond our borders, for we may make friends and we sure know we'll have enemies. But for now we seek to understand just what is beyond our borders rather than what is beyond our side of the globe."
SRA_idea_historical_tensions: "Historical Tensions"
SRA_idea_historical_tensions_desc: "The Confederate States and the history of the south as a whole is mired in slavery, Jim Crow, Segregation and lord knows what all else. Regardless of this troubled and bloody past we must seek a way to shake off the specter of old and look to improve not only our image but the lives of every Southern citizen."
