CSA_focus_logistical_centric_planning: "Logistical Centric Planning"
CSA_focus_logistical_centric_planning_desc: "LCP is a different approach to military operations then what standard doctrine would see practiced in the field. While our movements may be more sparse, our supply lines and ability to supply our troops will result in an overall efficiency increase. The hope is by tooling our doctrine and style of organization to be more logistically inclined, this'll allow us to be more thoughtful of how we plan while minimizing overall losses in equipment and hopefully troops themselves."
CSA_focus_jrotc_education_requirements: "JROTC Education Requirements"
CSA_focus_jrotc_education_requirements_desc: "Passive exposure to the military is the best way to draw in new recruits as well as build national pride for the armed forces. As such we will work jointly with the education institutions and military to create a dedicated apparatus to ensure that students will do at least two years of the JROTC program within their high school years of schooling."
CSA_focus_equal_opportunity_officer_training_program: "Opportunity Officers Training Program"
CSA_focus_equal_opportunity_officer_training_program_desc: "To ensure the quality of leadership and that the leadership roles needed to organize a standing army are filled, we must create a new OTP or officer training program. The goal of the OOTP is to create an environment which encourages non-commissioned officers as well as civilians looking to join the military to apply and train to be an officer. This will function like a basic training but for the officer class, howeveer it will have significantly more requirements and standards set to ensure the quality of our officer corps is kept in check."
CSA_focus_well_rounded_army: "Well Rounded Army"
CSA_focus_well_rounded_army_desc: "With our initial reforms and new standards being set our army has become stable enough to properly hold its own. We now have the ability to break out and set a sort of direction we want to take our army for the future of our national defense and foreign policy."

CSA_focus_doctrine_debates_desc: "With the creation and solid foundation we have made with our army service branch, it has now become apparent that we need to understand the direction or doctrine we'll be using to bring ourselves victory in the modern battlefield. As such we need to review our options and understand just exactly what is it we need for the future we desire for the branch."
CSA_focus_civil_defense_doctrine: "Civil Defense Doctrine"
CSA_focus_civil_defense_doctrine_desc: "The CDD is a doctrine of personal honor and pride. Through using the hunting and gun culture of our region and the old US, we can refine independent programs and regulate them to be in line of a sort of \"private national guard\". This means that militia units and organizations as well as semi-trained civilians will be easier to either want to join or conscript if and when the duty calls. This of course means that any offensive war will be looked down upon as the doctrine focuses more on home defense rather than personal offense. But these supposed \"3.5 gen warfare\" tactics will help to keep our enemy guessing."
CSA_focus_funding_independent_company_programs: "Funding Independent Company Programs"
CSA_focus_funding_independent_company_programs_desc: "The ICPs are a series of nationally funded programs to set up \"companies\", or independent local units assigned to a specific area or township. Of course the catch is that in the case of a defensive war these companies if need be, can be called up to join the regular army until the end of said war."
CSA_focus_rotc_and_jrotc_standards: "ROTC & JROTC Standards"
CSA_focus_rotc_and_jrotc_standards_desc: "The implementation of JROTC and ROTC programs into the education system was a nice way to passively expose the population to the idea of the military as a whole. However we must retool these programs to ensure and pre-emptively train our citizens in how to defend, lead and understand why we fight for hearth and home."
CSA_focus_continual_planning_doctrine: "Continual Planning Doctrine"
CSA_focus_continual_planning_doctrine_desc: "The CPD is a doctrine focused around the planning apparatus of the army. Operations, intelligence and so forth are all influences of planning and its with this notion that we set ourselves up with the knowledge to better refine, improve and scale planning itself to ensure results over just raw force of material and manpower. After all, strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory and yet tactics without strategy is just noise before defeat."
CSA_focus_improving_logistical_standards: "Improving Logistical Standards"

CSA_focus_orienteering_proficiency_training_desc: "The joke of the old military is that butter bars, or fresh commissioned officers are always easily lost on land nav training. As such lets take this to heart and make land nav our primary study. This will allow our force cohesion and terrain understandings to be way more flexible than traditional training would allow."
CSA_focus_shells_not_soldiers_doctrine: "Shells Not Soldiers Doctrine"
CSA_focus_shells_not_soldiers_doctrine_desc: "SNS doctrine is a material centric doctrine. Using the principles that shells, big or small are better in quantity than just simply little manpower of quality. The main point is that you can make more bullets and shells quicker than you can make a new soldier of standard. This'll be a bit more taxing on our economy, but it should set a better idea of everyone for the war effort than just the soldiers itself which leads to a more cohesive and less ego driven societal split to or not to join the army."
CSA_focus_increasing_production_abilities: "Increasing Production Abilities"
CSA_focus_increasing_production_abilities_desc: "In order to keep up with such a demanding doctrine we need to understand just how we can increase the raw material outputs with what we already have."
CSA_focus_logistical_elitism: "Logistical Elitism"
CSA_focus_logistical_elitism_desc: "Our doctrine means we need the ability to carry and fetch all these bullets, bombs and supplies to boot. Therefore the logistical corps will be elevated to a sort of \"special forces\" in their own right. Not only that, in modern combat we must do what we can to shelter these vital supplies from the enemy air units, thus the emphasis on the logistics corps is also an increase to their very likelihood of death on, around and near any war we find ourselves in."
CSA_focus_true_southern_army: "A True Southern Army"
CSA_focus_true_southern_army_desc: "Our doctrine debates are over, our army is the well oiled machine for which to secure our nation and its interests. From here we create a pillar towards solidifying a truly modern general staff leadership."
CSA_focus_southern_air_force: "The Southern Air Force"
CSA_focus_southern_air_force_desc: "The space coast, the wright brothers, these are a few examples of our nation's vibrant history with flight itself. It is this history which makes a certainty that the creation of an air force service branch is not only a need, but a right by historic tradition as well. We shall make an air force to set a new historic mile stone to make our ancestors proud of."
CSA_focus_air_r_and_d_department: "Air Force R&D Department"
CSA_focus_air_r_and_d_department_desc: "A specialized department within the air force is needed to keep ahead of the curve militarily speaking. However through civilian contracting this can serve a civilian application as well, overall boosting things like air travel and air transport innovations."

CSA_focus_raining_thunder_doctrine: "Raining Thunder Doctrine"
CSA_focus_raining_thunder_doctrine_desc: "This doctrine prioritizes the ground attack and bombing capabilities of our air force. This prioritization will rely on the current trend of aircraft development to be sufficient enough to deal with wrestling control of the skies while whatever bombers we have will decimate enemy ground and naval forces to prevent any real harm done to our overall war fighting abilities. After all, factories can be rebuilt, soliders killed can not."
CSA_focus_wright_aircraft_production_company: "Wright Aircraft Production Company"
CSA_focus_wright_aircraft_production_company_desc: "The Wright brothers pioneered the first sustained flight and set the stage for a whole new understanding of travel. Now we honor their name by establishing the WAP company in North Carolina for both civil and military aircraft production."

CSA_focus_national_aviation_association_desc: "The NAA is a joint military and civilian membership group which organizes events throughout the nation to inspire and inform the public of the beauties of flight and the machines as well as the people behind those machines.

CSA_focus_southern_skies_for_southern_eyes_desc: "Our air force is a proud and determined branch which makes up but a portion of the Southern Military Forces.

CSA_focus_southern_navy: "Southern Navy"
CSA_focus_southern_navy_desc: "Despite the wealth of coastline we have our naval forces are not really the best. Most naval power comes from the Atlantic coastline or over there in the pacific. However given the Mississippi river and the gulf of Mexico, we do have ample training grounds to refine and make due with a naval force of our choosing."
CSA_focus_naval_maintenance_standardization: "Naval Maintenance Standardization"
CSA_focus_naval_maintenance_standardization_desc: "Our naval facilities are very specialized and tend to be a bit of a logistical mess. As such we need to create a general standard to allow facility flexibility in order to take in any ship in need of repairs."
CSA_focus_family_pay_incentives: "Family Pay Incentives"
CSA_focus_family_pay_incentives_desc: "Naval vessels take a lot of people to man, the people will also be more or less isolated on any missions or wars we may somehow find ourselves in for days at a time. Its with this in mind that we must seek out a better justification for our naval personnel to take upon such a burden that pay will have an adaptive family stipend to allow for soldiers to not only cover themselves but the family they have at home."
CSA_focus_propulsion_testing_program: "Propulsion Testing Program"
CSA_focus_propulsion_testing_program_desc: "Modern ships are big and stuffed to the brim with a lot of weapondry. We need to find ways to make our vessels more agile, making sure the enemy wastes munitions and is forced to use heavy stuff like missiles. This soft form of attritional warfare at sea will allow us to hopefully keep a real standard with the added benefit of long term cost reductions in times of crisis."
CSA_focus_njrotc_programs: "NJROTC Programs"
CSA_focus_njrotc_programs_desc: "While the JROTC programs can be any service branch which the education institution would like to have a program there, naval programs are a lot more unqiue to give students real exposure to the navy itself. Therefore a certain radius of schools close to the coastline or Mississippi river will have dedicated Naval JROTC programs on top of what may be already present. The goal is to allow these naval JROTC programs to have funding and access to major water ways to allow for more hands on understandings of certain things the students could be expected to do if they chose to go into the navy."
CSA_focus_general_training_improvements: "General Training Improvements"

CSA_focus_what_color_water_debate_desc: "Having a naval force enough to defend is one thing, however we have a real choice to be made for the future security of our nation.

CSA_focus_if_it_floats_its_a_boat: "If It Floats, Its A Boat"
CSA_focus_if_it_floats_its_a_boat_desc: "Quantity over quality. The life long debate is something which many struggle with as each has its ups and downs. However we may have just found a way to make quantity viable again for a naval force. By shrinking, standardizing and streamlining things like ship designs and personnel training, we set up the game to allow our naval force to be responsive through volume rather than overtly percise stikes. The enemy morale will surely take a hint and some seeing ocean dissapear into a wave of steel and guns."
CSA_focus_the_steel_wave_doctrine: "The Steel Wave Doctrine"
CSA_focus_the_steel_wave_doctrine_desc: "The Steel Wave Doctrine is a quantity doctrine focused on scaling naval vessels and training around these new smaller standards.

CSA_focus_fleet_standards_doctrine_desc: "The FSD is a doctrine which refines and sets a standard to fleet size and composition to allow our navy to be organized similarly as how an army would be.

southern_republic_domestic_policies: "Southern Domestic Policies"
southern_republic_domestic_policies_desc: "Despite the black and white as well as very red stained history the South has had, modern demographic shifts had tempered a fair amount of the more excessive forces once at play. Despite this however those very same forces have adapted and seemingly will not go away without kicking and screaming, for lack of better words. Nevertheless we must look to overcome these excesses and ensure the tranquility and survival of our new nation. After all, yall know we got a reputation to uphold with southern hospitality."
southern_republic_federal_budgets: "Government Expenses"
southern_republic_federal_budgets_desc: "The central government of the SRA or Southern Republic is an interesting one to say the least. With no one really liking the word \"federal\", they instead just bypass it with lingo like governmental expenses.

southern_republic_army_service_branch: "The Southern Army"
southern_republic_army_service_branch_desc: "The SAB or Southern Army is a highly traditional branch of the Southern Military Forces.

southern_republic_air_force_service_branch: "Southern Air Force"
southern_republic_air_force_service_branch_desc: "The Southern Air Force or SAF is a sort of neglected step child in terms of honest investment into its training and R&D department.

southern_republic_event.1.t: "The Capital Question"
southern_republic_event.1.d: "In the wake of the aftermath that was the \"Great Riots\" of the former United States, many of the local governors are scrambling to make their states as appealing to an independent body of where the new Republic's capital should be. Some believe that is should be as central as possible and place the city of Meridian Mississippi as an optimal option. Some believe only Atlanta is the real choice being one of the most developed metropolitan areas of the South. While some site historic symbolism and wish to have Charleston as the new capital, whatever the choice is it'll need to be sooner rather than later if we are to actually focus on our more pressing problems."
southern_republic_event.1.o1: "We Just Went Through That And We're Doing A Damn Beauty Contest!?!"
southern_republic_event.2.t: "The Committee's Choice"
southern_republic_event.2.d: "After a handful of days as well as many pressures exerted by local officials to choose them the committee has come up with four distinctive choices. New Orleans for its trading hub and naval apparatus, Meridian in Mississippi for its strategically centrality when thinking of the old confederacy. Then there is Atlanta, the South's most developed metropolitan hub, which economically and governing wise would be kind of commonsense of a choice. Finally there is the historic symbolism that is making Charleston the capital. Charleston appeals to the right as well as it appeals to the Southern identity movement that's been growing ever more. regardless the committee's choice is what determines who gets what."
southern_republic_event.2.o1: "New Orleans Obviously Beats Atlanta"
southern_republic_event.2.o2: "The Heart of Dixie Should Be The Heart, Meridian It Is"
southern_republic_event.2.o3: "Atlanta Is The Only Real Choice Here"
southern_republic_event.2.o4: "Our History Is Our Identity, Charleston Is Chosen"
southern_republic_event.3.t: "The Political Theater"
southern_republic_event.3.d: "The Southern states is host to a complete natural disaster's worth of political factions and ideological influences. Not only does the South have to worry about the natural disasters of mother nature herself but of the excesses and fighting of its political extremes. From niche Klan members, to Socialist revolutionaries we have to properly navigate this storm if we are to enjoy what little peace we've been able to establish so far."
southern_republic_event.3.o1: "These Rabble Are No Threat"
southern_republic_event.3.o2: "We Should Be More Cautious About Who Can Be Elected"
southern_republic_event.4.t: "A Stable Parties"
southern_republic_event.4.d: "In the wake of our political revival, we must look to who could properly make us a more stable nation. These \"moderates\" as the jeering from the alt-right and alt-left tend to label them as indicate that these are the more cautious parties. Looking for change but not in a sort of marathon manner, but rather a nice stroll or light jogging pace, we must understand just who these parties are if we are to help ensure they solidify support over the other more rebellious type parties."
southern_republic_event.4.o1: "Thank God For Cautious People"
southern_republic_event.5.t: "The Southern Conservatives Party"
southern_republic_event.5.d: "The SCP is a fairly moderate party in the grand scheme of the \"Stable\", group of parties. Being generally a center-right party it tends to be more of a reminder of the old democratic and republican parties and their moderate wings. Being more for gradual change rather than large swift changes, this party ensures that if change is needed its tackled in a more thought out manner rather than the fanfare mentality that can arise in more sensitive topics. In terms of social policies it ensures that change is always happening but we must embrace it at a comfortable pace to keep the national cohesion. Economically they are for deregulation, but not opposed to more commonsense based regulations to curb exploitative means."

southern_republic_event.5.o3: "The PDP Shall Prevail"
southern_republic_event.6.t: "The Wig Party of Dixie"
southern_republic_event.6.d: " The WPD is a more classical liberal party which aims to use the old school of liberal doctrine to secure a stable and progressing government to ensure the freedom and equality for all. Seeking more of equal opportunity availability the WDP is socially more fluid towards changes but does not see the need to enforce governmental sactions unless the issue at hand is not truly handled at the state and or local levels first. Economically they believe in regulations overall with a focus in anti-monopoly or more generally anti-competetive practices regulation. But aside from this sort of \"fair game\" strategy in regulations the WDP prefer a more off hands approach if and when possible."

southern_republic_event.6.o3: "Economic Amalgamates Are Anti-Southern"
southern_republic_event.7.t: "The Progressive Democracy Party"
southern_republic_event.7.d: "The PDP is a more traditional democratic-socialist party like its European counterparts, the party looks to use the powers of democracy to ensure the fair treatment of the workers of the nation and wishes to usher in a soft socialism. This means socially speaking the party is more liberal with only holding traditional values on what the voting majority believe is worth keeping traditional. Economically they are soft Socialists, looking to use the power of regulations to keep the workers fed and cared for they are not entirely pro-nationalization however if the private sector acts to unruly it is not out of the question as a stand in to help the exploited masses."

southern_republic_event.7.o3: "The PDP Shall Create Southern Socialism"
southern_republic_event.8.t: "The Federalize Dixie Party"
southern_republic_event.8.d: "The FDP is esentially the compromising party. Looking to find a happy middle ground of the federal unitarian type government of the union and the more heavily minarchist confederate government, the FDP wishes to marry the two into an earnest and father like figure of a structure to keep peace as well as order to the nation at large. Being both socially and economically off hand its only plans are to direct central funding and services to the poorest of regions to ensure the very bottomline of the nation is not so far down from the rest. Many lambast this as pseudo-socialism, but the FDP fires back at them wondering how much do these supposed \"honorable members of state\" really care about its constituants or do they care more about their friends and paycheck."

southern_republic_event.8.o3: "The SLP Will Liberate Dixie"
southern_republic_event.9.t: "The Southern Identity Party"
southern_republic_event.9.d: "The SIP is a niche kind of single issue party. They are more socially indifferent, leading to any and all major social issues to be handled locally rather than nationally. In terms of economics they are a sort of, \"if it isn't broke don't fix it\", kind of mentality. Meaning they'll do regulations or deregulations, but only if its percieved as a genuine issue to the economic stability of the nation. As for the supposed single issue, the SIP has most of its focus on cultivating and ensuring a real and concrete plan to create a Southern identity. Using things like the more minarchist views of the old confederacy mixed in with some stylistic inspirations from them as well as promoting local food and music culture as Southern culture. The party wishes to move away from the past and make a future that is earnestly and equally Southern for all."

southern_republic_event.9.o3: "Dixie Liberty For Dixie Values"
southern_republic_event.10.t: "The Southern Liberty Party"
southern_republic_event.10.d: "The SLP is an interesting makeup of a party. Being more or less the remnants of the old Libertarian Party, the SLP has decided to embrance a compromise of Southern cultural and governmental values with a Libertarian spin to help with the complete decentralization. Many in the SLP see a full return to either pro-Libertarianism and or pro-Confederation of government as a shear way to recreating the failure that was the Articles of Confederation. Regardless the party is anti-government intervention in the economy and socially it is very hands off, leaving such things to the state governments means that locals handle local issues. Though the SLP is not afraid of things like welfare and healthcare programs to ensure the bottomline of the nation are able to have some kind of footing to kick in the door of opportunity."

southern_republic_event.10.o3: "Southern Liberty Is Southern Governing"
southern_republic_event.11.t: "The Outlier Parties"
southern_republic_event.11.d: "Within the general Overton window of the southern republic, we have two distinctive parties which some honestly debate if they are even real political parties to begin with. Regardless first off we have the DDP or Dixie & Delta Party. Founded by a former railroad enthusiast turned novice political leader, this party seems to be more of and single party issue in relation to public transportation. However they have elluded to the fact that said investments in PT as they call it for short, would indeed have knock on economic effects when it comes to urbanization as well as connectivity within the nation itself. On the Other hand we have the Party for Economic Prosperity or PEP for short. This party styles itself as a party focused on economic development and ensuring the standards of the nation are brouth up through real economic investments. What they don't tell you is that said party is also full of big agricultural money as well as a soft plantation class of supporters. Regardless both the PEP and DPP are seen as interesting forces on their own right but nothing to far to shake the foundations."

southern_republic_event.100.d: "In the lead up to the first elections, the state of the nation has been too much to bear for many. As a result rising radicalism has been seen on both sides of the poltiical scene. With neo-confederates, fascist and much more on the right. The union of revolution and southern communist association leading the charge on the left. Many wonder just who will take the wind out of the sails of the other sides. For now continued rise in factionalism has resulted in..."

southern_republic_event.101.d: "The Confederate Workers Party deperate to keep ahead in the polls has recently sought out the help of the Southern Tradition Party. These two while fairly opposite of one another have united on the principle of \"The Confederate Dream\". Hoping to establish the rightful south and restore the lands of old, these two opposites have seemingly attracted one another in a gamble for the first election victorty of the new nation. For the first steps are the most important in the road to recovery and stability."

southern_republic_event.102.t: "The Agrarian Society"
southern_republic_event.102.d: "The main counter push and equally as desperate Union of Revolution Party has seen fit to align itself with the Agrarian Union Party. These two working together create the perfect oxymoron as one is clearly an oligarchic big agriculture party and the other is the closest thing to anarcho-communism that you'll see. But in desperate times calls for desperate measures. Both parties believe that the true pillar to a stable and complacent society is that of the agrarian society. Simple organization and most production efforts and organized labor goes towards making food, what better way to mold the society then by giving it a basic fundamental of living itself. Regardless they'll have to push hard as things are heating up as the elections come ever closer."

southern_republic_event.200.t: "The Right Consolidates"
southern_republic_event.200.d: "With the recent shift in the national ethos, many have been cozying up to more right wing parties. This has moderates and left wingers greatly concerned given the nation's history. Regardless fears came to a head as the Dixie First Party and League Of The South united under the Dixie Purity League. Many locals fear the near tumble of backward social reforms the league may create which has already resulted in a steady migration out from the nation. With fears of the Neo-confederates and fascist uniting many are looking at any real alternatives so they might stop such a force from winning the election."

southern_republic_event.201.d: "With the consolidation of the \"Fringe Right\", as opposition nationalist proclaim and sneer at them, many would be targets of such policies have begun to enlist and as a result the political clout of the military has become more and more swaying in its influence. With this the Modern Monarchist Movement known as the House Of Meridian has joined forces with the armed forces to consolidate a counter nationalist movement. Many are hopefull that if we must go down such a path that at least duty to country is better than anything a fascist or ultra-nationalist leadership would have."

southern_republic_event.12.d: "Our neighbors to the west have demanded our subjugation, the promise supposedly, to emulate the independence of the Texan state as a confederal partner within the Southern nation. We're not sure what their end game is, but it's up to our own belief in our military forces whether we can earnestly refuse such demands."

They promise a fair self governance but with the main goal being to unite foreign policy wise in a new regional union. This may be very advantageous to our situation as it would nullify our international sanctions under the guise of not \"existing\".

southern_republic_event.36.d: "One of the problems with the old republic was the old capital of D.C. was seen as too far away for a vast majority of the nation. however its symbolism cannot be discounted as well. We must therefore figure out just where our new capital should be."

southern_republic_event.37.d: "With our policies set in stone and our influences assured we now have the great honor of choosing a new look for our nation. Of course the consensus is to rename the nation to the Confederate States of America as it is only right that we pay tribute to our past and origins. But the question now is the flag. Members of the Dixie First Party want to do the Virginia Battle Flag and update the color scheme so its not just the Virginia Battle Flag as our greate Confederacy is not just the tight asses of Virginian aristocracy. However members apart of the League of the South wish to take it a step further and use a flag their members have been using a while now which is a plain Virginia Battle Flag with no stars on it but instead a white circle in the center with one large lighting bolt in the center. Some wonder if the latter would be a bit on the nose in terms of political appeal. However more still wonder if its not going far enough, after all this land is truly our land."

southern_republic_event.38.d: "With most of the nation on board with how we run things there is a general debate on if our nation truly represents itself. Many on the left want to rebrand the flag with socialist symbolism to set a precedent of solidarity with the nation's workers. While those who are on the right want to take things back a little bit to be more symbolic with our nation's origins by reintroducing one of the last flags which the confederacy represented itself with. This flag would be the old blood stain flag which has a white base flag with a solid red bar on the right hand side and in the top left corner sits the Virginia Battle Flag. Consequently they believe the national name should be changed to simply the Republic of Dixie. However it's up to the public to decide on this."

southern_republic_event.44.d: "In the aftermath of the supposed \"proclaimation\" of statehood, the agitation in the state of Florida has steadily rose over the past few more days. This escalation brings fears that our young nation will soon enough be embroiled in war, not with the federals, great lakers or even the Texans but with our own people...

  ######## Native Exodus Events #########
CSA_event_native_exodus.1.t: "Oklahoma Rumors"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1.d: "As we attempt something to organize our nation, rumors are coming out of the far lands of Oklahoma that the native population is looking to leave when and where possible. The threat and stigma of a \"Southern\" nation is still pretty strongly resonating, though who could be surprised considering most natives were relegated to specific chucks of land. We can't do much but hope it doesn't cause trouble for us in the future."
CSA_event_native_exodus.1.o1: "Wait If They Leave, Do We Get IT For Free Then?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.2.t: "Growing Migration"
CSA_event_native_exodus.2.d: "As we continue to solidify our national control, more and more natives from the Oklahoman mega reservation simply known as \"Indian Territory\", have continued to organize migration movements north towards Kansas. While it is a sad day to be losing so many people, this does mean that by proxy, reintegration efforts and getting the economy in the state back online will likely be a lot easier over all."
CSA_event_native_exodus.2.o1: "Shouldn't We Be Concerned With How Many Leave?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.3.t: "Migration Or Exodus?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.3.d: "More news out of Oklahoma as news of an organization called the Reclamation Front has been the responsible party for organizing these migration patterns from Oklahoma to Kansas. Reports from the region say that Kansas while under a new governmental entity called the Republic of Lakota is technically under their control, most real efforts have been spent on the northern four states as the debate over a new national capital and rebuilding has been a priority. The RF claims that Kansas is a fine new home away from the other \"colonial ran nations\" and that the Council of Six, a reference to the organizations' leadership as well as the six tribes which comprised the mega reservation. The Council has determined Kansas to be a better suited more stable home for which we can claim if need be. We're trying to get more info but it looks like rather than fight us, this supposed Reclamation Front believes the Republci of Lakota would be easier to fight and use Kansas as their one true home."
CSA_event_native_exodus.3.o1: "You Think We Should Tell Them?...Naaah"
CSA_event_native_exodus.4.t: "Just How Many Of Them Were There???"
CSA_event_native_exodus.4.d: "More news out of Oklahoma as the highest numbers of migrants out of the state have been reached. With estimates surmounting a roughly seven percent depopulation due to the mass migration many wonder just how many natives actually comprised of the state's population. Whatever it may be god help them in Kansas as who knows what trouble the locals are giving them."
CSA_event_native_exodus.4.o1: "Thank God Its No Longer Our Problem"
CSA_event_native_exodus.5.t: "A New Prosperity"
CSA_event_native_exodus.5.d: "With migration numbers nearing a stoppage of sorts we have a lot of vacated land, businesses and whatnot. As such these lands and so on can be refurbished and used to create a new prosperity which the state has yet to see. Lets just hope we can keep it that way considering what's lead to this somehow fortunate turn of events."
CSA_event_native_exodus.5.o1: "Well Now What?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1001.t: "What Now?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1001.d: "As the debates go on about the new capital, some rumors from the south have begun to reach us. Supposedly a ever growing influx of native americans have been fleeing Oklahoma and settling into Kansas. While we don't know what the reasonings or if there is an issue to be had as hand here, we do know that right now it is not a problem."
CSA_event_native_exodus.1001.o1: "Come Back When It's A Problem Please"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1002.t: "Again, Seriously"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1002.d: "More news coming from Kansas, apparently more natives have fled over into Kansas and as a result the developmental potential has increased as a proxy. Doesn't sound like a bad thing to me tbh."
CSA_event_native_exodus.1002.o1: "Is There A Reason You Came Back?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1003.t: "God What Now?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1003.d: "Further news out of Kansas as a group called the Reclamation Front has announced its intention to help the state of Kansas rebuild and grow. This appears to be a mild challenging of our authority, but with such a skimpy state and our solidifying control over the majority of the nation, we have no earnest concern with these rabble rousers."
CSA_event_native_exodus.1003.o1: "Now Can I Focus On My Work Please"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1004.t: "Yes?"
CSA_event_native_exodus.1004.d: "Kansas leadership has expressed their greatfulness in allowing the RF to help rebuild the state, over all things have been pretty peaceful and are looking to be for a while. But many up north are wary as such random kindness does not just happen for the sake of \"good will\". We'll be sending representatives to figure just what we're dealing with soon enough."
