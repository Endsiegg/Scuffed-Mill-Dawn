 # Events
 iraqi_events.1.t: "New Year Reports"
 iraqi_events.1.d: "As the year 2000 dawns upon Iraq, the nation finds itself grappling with a host of formidable challenges that threaten its stability and progress. Iraq continues to grapple with the suffocating impact of international sanctions imposed following the Gulf War. These sanctions have severely hampered the country's ability to rebuild its infrastructure, revive its economy, and provide essential services to its citizens. The restrictions on trade and financial transactions have resulted in a stagnant economy, high unemployment rates, and widespread poverty. The scarcity of resources and limited access to vital technologies further exacerbate Iraq's struggles. Furthermore, Iraq's political isolation persists as suspicions linger among the international community regarding the government's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and its alleged human rights abuses. This isolation hampers Iraq's ability to establish fruitful diplomatic relations, engage in mutually beneficial partnerships, and regain its rightful place in the global stage. Internally, Iraq faces deep-seated social discontent arising from the mismanagement of resources, systemic corruption, and inadequate public services. These issues have led to public frustration, deteriorating trust in the government, and a growing sense of disillusionment among the population. Addressing these grievances is crucial for fostering social cohesion and ensuring the well-being of the Iraqi people."
 iraqi_events.1.a: "Interesting"
 iraqi_events.2.t: "Iraq asks for our aid"

Since great damage has been done to the Iraqi infrastructure and energy, it seems that they are asking any country that has power in the region to help them settle things down in their own country. It seems they want us to do our part too, in electricity and gas imports. Surely this is a tempting offer for us since our influence in Iraq would become greater. How should we respond to their offer?"

The Chinese and Russians have their BRICS and SCO, and the Europeans have their EU. Hence, it is the duty of the resistance to create one Union for the Ummah.\nIf this suggestion gets put into action, the resistance and the Islamic world will enter a new era."

Since we are a Shia country, and the fact that we are also close to the Axis of Resistance, has made both the Iraqis and the Iranians to ask us join this new Union. Surely, the benefits of this union will truly be "Prosperous" for us."
 iraqi_events.11.a: "We will join them."

A provisional government has ascended to power in Iraq, and a new constitution is in the midst of being drafted. Unfortunately, this order has not gone to plan. Many former soldiers of the Iraqi army are putting up resistance in pockets around cities, with some even joining extremist groups.

Following the collapse of Saddam's regime, Iraq faced relative instability, with the recent events being the tipping point in the conflict. Many Iraqi's, especially the Sunni's, hope that Al-Douri and his Ba'ath party can restore Iraqi hegemony and the security Iraqi's enjoyed under the former regime.

As a result, the vast majority of Iraqi officers declared that they will not involve themselves in the conflict, and will be loyal to any regime in charge.

The Guards swiftly removed the flashlight and Saddam went back to sleep. The house keeper no longer works at the palace."

 iraq_md.304.d: "For several days, Saddam had been complaining about the lack of Chocolate in the palace. Because of this, his assistants could not put up with his complaining for much longer, and eventually just took him to the store as he insisted he wanted to personally pick out the brand of chocolate himself. As the guards and assistants were distracted by the crowd forming outside, one of them noticed that Saddam was trying to whisper into the ear of the clerk, and overheard him saying "Listen, if you ensure that our ships flow through Hormuz without problem, and you go back on your deal with the Omani's and Iranian's, then I will give you a very favorable price for any future oil deals". The Guards then swiftly bought the chocolate, and escorted Saddam back to the palace."

He went on to describe how he felt sorry for tainting a local towns water supply with apple-cider vinegar. A nosey maid came across this letter, and reported it to one of Saddam's close assistants, who immedietaly went on to have a talk with Saddam about how he did not commit such a crime. Saddam insisted that he did, and that he could no longer stand the guilt. The assistant then reluctantly brought a nutrionist to inform Saddam about the health benefits of apple-cider vinegar, and how instead he helped the locals rather than harm. Saddam then secretly wrote and published a patriotic letter pleading with everyone to drink apple-cider vinegar so that Iraq may have "The Earths Finest Soldiers"."

The guards then realized something was wrong, and took him under their protection momentarily until he fell asleep."

 iraq_md.307.d: "Without informing the palace's kitchen, or anyone as a matter of fact, Saddam began laying out plates on the palace's dinner-table and had called over some regional diplomats in order to hold a diplomatic dinner to discuss regional problems. This resulted in the guests being interrogated by the guards stationed in the palace upon their arrival, causing a commotion that could have been totally avoided had Saddam just informed others of his plans. The guests were eventually let in, forgetting that he invited the guests in the first place, Saddam had not prepared any food for the guests, so they were presented with cold, leftover food that he frantically took from the kitchen."
 iraq_md.307.a: "How embarrassing"
 iraq_md.308.t: "Saddam Rehearses a Previously Televised Speech for Hours"
 iraq_md.308.d: "For hours, Saddam's care-givers had not seen him leave his room, as they believed he was rehearsing a quick speech that he had planned for later that day. Out of concern, they began trying to listen to what he was saying and one of them recognized the speech as his previous one about the American invasion. An assistant was later told to enter the room to inform Saddam that he had already given the speech years ago, and he did so with fear and reluctance. Saddam then furiously threw the papers against the wall and told the assistant to get out. Later that day the sounds of a crying Saddam could be heard the palace."
 iraq_md.308.a: "Damn.."
 iraq_md.309.t: "Saddam Mistakes a Fridge for a Safe"
 iraq_md.309.d: "This morning, Saddam turned the palace upside down as he frantically searched for his money that he had stored in a secured safe within a vault.

 iraq_md.310.t: "Saddam Starts a Fire!"
 iraq_md.310.d: "Earlier today when Saddam was visiting a local village on the outskirts of Rutbah, Saddam lit a cigar which he forgot to put out or even smoke.

 iraq_md.311.t: "Saddam Gets on the Wrong Flight!"
 iraq_md.311.d: "Saddam had been adamant about meeting the President of the France, [FRA.GetLeader]. The meeting was agreed upon, and the flight was prepared. During the flight, Saddam insisted that he knew the way to France as he in his own words, "had been to France many times". As a result, the pilot had to agree to Saddam's verbal directions and ended up in the middle of French Guiana instead. The meeting was then promptly cancelled."
 iraq_md.311.a: "Can we have him back please?"
 iraq_md.312.t: "Saddam Misses Crucial Security Summit"
 iraq_md.312.d: "Saddam had arranged plans for a national security summit, where his top generals and officers were asked to attend. Yesterday was when the summit was meant to take place, and upon the arrival of all the officials, they were greeted with silence as they all patiently waited for Saddam Hussein to address the room. To their surprise, Saddam Hussein never showed up. Instead it was revealed that Saddam was busy on a fishing trip with Qussay and Uday at the Euphrates river."
 iraq_md.312.a: "Good for him"
 iraq_md.313.t: "Saddam Mistakes Festival Parade for a Military March"
 iraq_md.313.d: "This morning, Saddam was being driven to an official's office for a meeting that they had arranged. On his way there, he saw a street being blocked off for a planned parade being held there, which he mistook for a military parade. He than told his driver to pull over, and Saddam rushed to the podium on the side of the street, kicking the announcer off the stage. He then began saluting in anticipation for the soldiers, but instead he was caught saluting cartoon characters as he swiftly realized that he was at a childrens parade."
 iraq_md.313.a: "Shit"
 iraq_md.314.t: "Saddam Orders the Construction of 500 New Bunkers!"
 iraq_md.314.d: "Fearing an imminent nuclear strike from the United States, Saddam had ordered the construction of 500 new bunkers to be built across Iraq. This was because he believed that Iraq was still at a state of war with the United States, and therefore he panicked. The orders were cancelled, but the construction companies still lost money and thus they must be justly compensated."
 iraq_md.314.a: "Shit"
 iraq_md.315.t: "Saddam Orders the Placement of Hundreds of Landmines in the Kurdistan Region to Combat Insurgents!"
 iraq_md.315.d: "Without consulting his military advisors, Saddam ordered the placement of hundreds of mines at the Kurdistan border in order to combat local insurgent groups. This order was swiftly fulfilled by those who received it, as they believed it was a serious one due to the recent uptick in attacks. But now top advisors to Saddam are warning that the mines could lead to some serious harm for our own troops."
 iraq_md.315.a: "Uh oh"
 iraq_md.316.t: "Saddam Hussein is Killed by a Landmine"
 iraq_md.316.d: "A few months back, Saddam Hussein decided that he wants to place hundreds of landmines near the Kurdish border in order to prevent attacks from local insurgents. Feeling that he is disliked by the Kurdish people, Saddam felt compelled to visit the region alone and meet locals as a show of good faith. Saddam then took a car from the palace, and began driving for hours to the Kurdistan border. There was just enough fuel in the car to get him to the border, and as the car ran low on gas, Saddam began moving on foot. Forgetting about the mines, somewhere on the way, Saddam stepped on a land mine and died on the spot."
