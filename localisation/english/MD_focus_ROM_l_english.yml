 #leader descs
 emil_constantinescu_desc: "Emil Constanstinescu was a senior member of the successor party to the National Peasants Party (PNT), which existed in the Kingdom of Romania but was dissolved after it was banned by the communist regime. In 1992, the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR), of which the PNTCD was a member, nominated him as its candidate for President of Romania. He lost the election to then-incumbent Ion Iliescu after the second round. In 1996, he competed once again for the presidency as the CDR's candidate and managed to defeat Iliescu in the second round, securing victory by a margin of roughly 10%. CDR's success in the 1996 general elections marked the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania. On the day he took office, he suspended his membership in the PNTCD, as the Constitution precludes a president holding formal membership in a political party during his tenure. Constantinescu's presidency was marked by ineffective implementation of the processes of privatization, which, bogged down by excessive bureaucracy, increased unemployment and poverty in the short term, coupled with another two mineriads that took place in 1999 and ended with the arrest of the leader behind the mineriads, Miron Cozma. Divides in the governing CDR coalition as a result of ideological differences and political instability have also caused the coalition to further fracture. As a new millennium came and with elections approaching, his popularity has fallen drastically and managed to give rise to the popularity of the ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor who is calling for radical measures to solve the problems that Romania has, and former president Ion Iliescu is looking to take the presidency once more. With all these issues, Constantinescu is unlikely to run for re-election"
 ion_ilescu_desc: "Ion Iliescu joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. However, beginning in 1971, he was gradually marginalized by Nicolae Ceausescu. Iliescu had a leading role in the Romanian Revolution, becoming the country's president in December 1989. In the first free elections since the establishment of the communist regime, which took place in 1990, he became Romania's first freely elected head of state. The governing power at the time, the National Salvation Front (FSN), split between supporters of Iliescu, which created the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), and Prime Minister Petre Roman, which created the Democratic Party (PD). Iliescu then won the 1992 elections against Emil Constantinescu but lost against him in the 1996 elections. Iliescu then managed to achieve victory against the ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor under the newly founded socialist PDSR."
 theodor_stolojan_desc: "During the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, Theodor Stolojan worked at the Ministry of Finances between 1972 and 1977 as an economist in the State Budget Department, then between 1978 and 1982 as Chief of Accountancy of the State Budget and then as deputy director of the Department for Foreign Exchange and International Financial Relations until the Romanian Revolution. He was the first finance minister since the fall of communism, playing a key role as an architect of free market reforms after the end of central planning and was deeply involved in revamping the financial system and launching privatisation. After the resignation of prime minister Petre Roman due to the events of the mineriads, Stolojan was appointed prime minister by the then president Ion Iliescu. However, due to the worsening economic situation in 1992, the Stolojan government began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices. The economic situation deteriorated, and inflation as well as unemployment increased substantially. Subsequently, he resigned as prime minister. In 2000, he re-entered politics as a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), and he ran for the presidency of Romania in the 2000 presidential elections, where he managed to strike a huge blow to his opponent, managing to surprise everyone with his election. Now Stolojan looks towards new economic reforms, increasing alignment with the west, and fighting corruption in order to modernize Romania."
 mugur_isarescu_desc: "Mugur Isarescu was a researcher for the Institute of International Economics. He took a number of courses in the United States, writing several papers on capitalist economics. In February 1990, after the Romanian revolution, Isarescu began working at the Romanian ministry of foreign affairs, and in March 1990, he was sent to work as an economic and monetary affairs secretary at the Romanian Embassy in the United States, being in charge of handling Romania's relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In July 1990, Isarescu was then recalled from his post in the United States in order to lead the Romanian National Bank (BNR). Isarescu's leadership of the BNR is considered by many to have saved the Romanian economy from total collapse due to his effective knowledge and leadership of the Bank. In 1999, after the resignation of prime minister Radu Vasile, Isarescu was asked to become prime minister of Romania, which he accepted on the condition that he could return to the National Bank after it was over. Then President Emil Constantinescu agreed with the terms, and on December 16, 1999, Isarescu was sworn in as Prime Minister of Romania. Isarescu, despite serving for one year, started economic reforms that improved the Romanian economy. Then, after the decision of President Emil Constantinescu not to run for a second term, Isarescu was nominated by what was left of the CDR governing coalition as the presidential candidate for the 2000 elections. Isarescu managed to surprise everyone by defeating all of his opponents and becoming the new President of Romania, and now Isarescu looks towards a pro-western foreign policy as well as a modernization of the Romanian economy."
 corneliu_vadim_tudor_desc: "During the communist era, Corneliu Vadim Tudor worked as a journalist, editor, and poet. In the early 1970s, he was one of the editors at Romania Libera, and after 1975, he was an editor at the Romanian official press agency. In 1991, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, along with Eugen Barbu, founded the Ultranationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM), which managed to gain massive support due to mass disillusion with the political status quo. In 1999, Dan Corneliu Hudici, a former reporter at Romania Mare, claimed there was a 'secret blacklist' of dozens of politicians (including then-president Emil Constantinescu), journalists, and businessmen to be arrested if Tudor's party came to power. This allegation only served to increase his popularity as a result of the unpopularity of President Emil Constantinescu. In the elections of 2000, Vadim stunned everyone with his big victory against former President and Communist Party official Ion Iliescu as a result of his rising popularity coupled with the unpopularity of his opposition candidates. Now Corneliu Vadim Tudor looks to eliminate the old political status quo and replace it with a strong Romanian state that includes the lands Romania lost after World War II."
 mihai_i_desc: "Following the victory of the PNTCD in the general elections and the monarchist faction in the referendum, the Kingdom of Romania was restored, and Michael once again returned to the throne. Having been King before between 1927–1930 and 1939–1947, Michael holds a vast amount of experience and knowledge, and his non-partisan stance makes him more than capable of reaching compromises in the Parliament. At the same time, Michael is beloved by Romanian society and seen as a symbol of both stability and democracy, as he promises to guide the country towards the brighter future that it deserves."

 ROM_revolution_legacy_desc: "On the 25th of December 1989 the brutal communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown in what is better known as the Romanian revolution, The effects of the revolution are still badly visible to our people as in it's aftermath Romania experienced massive economic problems as well as rampant poverty but our people remember the goals of the revolution which were to free Romania from an authoritarian regime and they will always remember that goal for many years to come "
 ROM_mineriad_legacy: "Fallout of the Mineriads"
 ROM_mineriad_legacy_desc: "The Mineriads were a series of protests and episodes of violence carried by the Jiu valley miners. Originally Started in 1990, by Coal Miners from Jiu Valley in Transylvania, demanding better wages and working conditions, the mineriads were essentially used by the ruling National Salvation Front Government, which was formed by Ion Iliescu after the fall of the Ceausescu regime to help repress anti-government protests by opposition parties, resulting in countless deaths and destruction caused by the clashes. Five more such events went on to happen, with the most recent one in February of 1999, which resulted in the arrest of Miron Cozma, The leader of the Jiu Valley Miners, therefore putting the mineriads to a close. The miner strikes had significant Social and Economic Impacts to our nation, with many societal scars being created as the result of the political polarization, which followed the mineriads. The mineriads also had the result of many foreign investors being scared away due to the unstable social and economic situation, Romania was in, which resulted in further economic instability. The Effects of these events will surely take a long time to fade from our society"

 ROM_romanian_economy_modifier_desc: "The Romanian Economy used to be one of the strongest economies within the eastern bloc, however the economic policies enacted by the Ceausescu regime in the late 1970’s and 1980’s, as well as the subsequent economic transition to capitalism, have left the Romanian Economy in ruins, with many once prominent sectors being in a state of near collapse. However if we manage to put a strong effort in reviving our land rich economy, we may see a miracle, never seen on the banks of the danube.\n§W--------------§!\n§RThe Choices You will make in the Economy tree, will shape this dynamic National Spirit, according to your choices, which will shape the Romanian Economy in a bold new direction therefore it is advised to tread carefully§!"

 ROM_safeguard_the_private_sector_desc: "Past Governments have been changing the Fiscal Code constantly, sometimes overnight, resulting in economic chaos.

 ROM_mechanized_farming_desc: "Iliescu's land reform from the 90s had the good effect of returning state owned land back to the farmers which initially owned them, but the reform wasn't comprehensive, it didn't provide any equipment nor incentive to work the land, thus our agriculture became heavily inefficient.

 ROM_balkan_economic_union_desc: "European integration is important, but so is Balkan integration. By creating an economic union, we can further promote free trade and the trafficking of goods between us and our neighbours.

 ROM_crown_council: "Restore The Crown Council"
 ROM_crown_council_desc: "As wise as Michael might be, leading a country is, regardless, a tough job. The King needs someone to advise him on matters of national importance, so we took the decision to restore the old Crown Council.

 ROM_crown_domains: "The Crown Domains"
 ROM_crown_domains_desc: "Royal dynasties are hard to mantain, and sometimes they live quite the black holes in the budget. But this wasn't always the case, nor does it need to be. Back in the days of the Old Kingdom, we had the Crown Domains—companies and institutions which used their profits to cover any and all expenses of the Royal Family, thus sparing our budget, and whatever surplus remained was reinvested. We can re-establish these domains to help our economic situation and promote development."
 ROM_decommunization: "De-Communization"
 ROM_decommunization_desc: "Communism is the reason why Romania is the way it is.

 ROM_guide_the_parties: "Guide The Parties"
 ROM_guide_the_parties_desc: "Time has shown again and again that, for the most part, the parties are really lackluster.

On the subject of Lukom-A, how are they even in Romania..?"
 ROM_peoples_royal_family: "The People's Royal Family"

 ROM_ban_extremism: "Ban Extremism"
 ROM_ban_extremism_desc: "Both right wing and left wing extremism are bad, i mean look at Vadim. Does he seem like a normal person? No. He's actively making balkan racism seem like a playground compared to his statements. It genuinely feels like he's trying to create competitive racism which is worrying more than anything. But, anyway, we will ban both nationalist and communist parties and heavily promote moderation."
 ROM_resolve_succession: "Resolve Succession"
 ROM_resolve_succession_desc: "At this moment, the Royal Family does not have a clear heir. There is, of course, Margareta, the daughter of Michael, who should seem like a clear choice. But she is nowhere near as popular as her father. This is not helped by the second contestant in the succession, the young Nicholas. He's popular, and according to our primogeniture, the males have priority. But these laws are outdated and ought to be changed. Regardless, we will assemble the Crown Council to help Michael take a decision."
 ROM_1947_avenged: "1947 Avenged"
 ROM_1947_avenged_desc: "5 decades. It took 5 decades for our greatest mistake to be undone. Romania, after all this time, has managed to return to its natural form of government—a Monarchy. No longer led by Presidents with shady interests and even shadier pasts, our country is now led by someone who is truly political neutral and only has our best interests at heart—King Michael I. Our country is proud again, and the future seems more bright than ever, but there is still work to be done, and as long as the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen remains on the throne, the work will never stop."

 ROM_monarchism_in_the_balkans_desc: "When the Soviet tanks overran the Balkans, our brethren over the Danube denounced the monarchist institution under the threat of the Russian rifle. They have continued to serve these ill Republican ideals even after the fall of the USSR, refusing to see that the very existence of Republicanism on this side of Europe is a mistake. We will help them get back on the right track."

Moments later, Tram 296 entered the underpass at 50 km/h. Although the driver noticed the stationary trams ahead, the brakes failed, leading Tram 296 to crash into the back of Tram 300, which was then pushed into Tram 110.

 romania_politics.21.d: "Massive protests have erupted across Romania following the failuer of the March on Bucharest, with crowds demanding Vadim's resignation over the widespread abuses he has committed during his time in power. The situation has grown increasingly volatile, and the risk of a full-blown revolution looms large if decisive action is not taken soon. While stepping down would be the most direct response to public pressure, there is also the option of calling on the military to restore order, though this could escalate tensions even further. The choice must be made carefully, as the future of the nation hangs in the balance."
 romania_politics.21.a: "Fuck this, I'm leaving."
 romania_politics.21.b: "I'm not going down anytime soon!"
 romania_politics.22.t: "Transylvania Secedes From Romania"
 romania_politics.22.d: "It seems we have made a grave mistake by involving the military. While suppression efforts were initially successful in Moldavia and Muntenia, units stationed in Transylvania refused to follow orders and instead defected. Many political opponents who had evaded previous purges managed to escape across the Carpathian Passes, where a 'Rival Government' has now been established in Cluj, with Funar reportedly apprehended. Efforts to restore order in Transylvania have faltered. Military units sent from Wallachia were intercepted in the Carpathian Passes, where skirmishes broke out. Our forces, unable to secure a foothold, were forced into retreat. The situation continues to spiral out of control as Transylvania consolidates its resistance."
 romania_politics.22.a: "Oh..."
 romania_politics.22.b: "Viata-n libertate, sau moarte! (play as Transylvania)"
 romania_politics.23.t: "Military Removes Vadim"
 romania_politics.23.d: "As Romania plunges further into chaos, the remnants of the military have been ordered to arrest Vadim, holding him responsible for the failure to preserve the nation's territorial integrity. At dawn, military units stormed the Cotroceni Palace, encountering only minimal resistance from the Palace Guards, who quickly stood down. Vadim's fate remains unclear, with reports suggesting he has been taken into custody for further questioning. In the wake of this power shift, Mircea Chelaru, the Chief of Staff, has assumed control of the government. Chelaru has declared a state of emergency and vowed to crush the ongoing rebellion in the Carpathians, promising swift military action to restore order and stability across the fractured country."
 romania_politics.23.a: "There's nothing we can do."
 romania_politics.24.t: "Death Of Corneliu Vadim Tudor"
 romania_politics.24.d.a: "Our beloved leader, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, has died unexpectedly of a heart attack earlier today at the Cardiovascular Diseases Center of the Army, leaving the nation in shock and mourning. Thousands of people have already began to gather in front of the Cotroceni Palace, laying flowers and candles for the father of our nation.\n\nHis rise to prominence has been nothing short of remarkable, from a measly MP to rising to President and then Conducator. Many enemies have tried along the way to destroy him, to destroy OUR goal, but they all failed. He had and will never have any equals. He was feared, respected, adored, he was larger-than-life, he was what Romania needed. Funeral arragements will be finalized in the following days, and millions are expected to turn out and pay their final respects.\n\nAnd now, as we brace for a future without him, one must ask: who wiull step up to fill the shoes of a man whose presence has once dominated every facet of political life?"
 romania_politics.24.d.b: "Former MP and founder of the PRM, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, has passed away unexpectedly of a heart attack earlier today at the Cardiovascular Diseases Center of the Army. Often described as a 'showman', his toxic and intolerant views had a real brainwashing effect upon the masses, leading him to a close victory in the 2000 elections and almost becoming President.\n\nWhat it would've been, we do not know. All we can do now is mourn an important figure in our post-communist history."

 romania_politics.50.t: "A New Union"
 romania_politics.50.d: "Centuries ago, Wallachia and Bulgaria were united under the empire forged by the brothers Asen and Peter, a powerful state that bridged the Carpathians and the Balkans. However, the fall of the Asenid Dynasty marked the disintegration of their empire, and the paths of the two nations diverged sharply. Wallachia grew under Hungarian and later Ottoman influence, while Bulgaria fell directly into Ottoman rule. Despite their shared history, the two nations drifted apart.\n\nIn the 19th century, following our hard-won independence and Bulgaria's newfound autonomy, there was a fleeting chance to reunite these two lands. However, foreign interventions and the political landscape of the time snuffed out any real possibility of union. But now, in the 21st century, we are at long last reunited and finally share a common cause.\n\nWhile the Bulgarians still might resent us for forcing this union upon them, overtime our people will become one. Let us hope that this time, the ties we forge will last."
 romania_politics.50.a: "Long Live the Union!"
 romania_politics.51.t: "Beautiful Bessarabia"
 romania_politics.51.d: "Some 100 years ago, Bessarabia and Romania were reunified into Greater Romania, only for the region to be lost once more in the wake of the Second World War. Following the Soviet annexation in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was absorbed into the Soviet Union, leading to decades of separation from Romania. Now that the territory is under our control again, the injustice committed by that cursed accord has been undone. We have a renewed opportunity to restore Bessarabia to its rightful place within our nation and address the scars left by years of foreign domination. While it may take decades, the region will be rebuilt, and we will make sure it thrives under the Romanian tricolore once more!"
 romania_politics.51.a: "Welcome back home!"
 romania_politics.52.t: "The Speech"
 romania_politics.52.d: "It's a warm evening, and Constantinescu prepares to give a speech to the nation, a speech that was not anounced nor debated  with his allies from the PNTCD and there is a clear reason why. As he sits down in the chair, as the cameras start rolling, he put's on a mask of solemnity and begins his address: 'Dear compatriots, I address you today, citizens of Romania, to inform you of my decision not to run for a new term as President of Romania.'\n\nAfter a brief pause, he continues, explaining the reasons for his drastic decision and the justification behind it. The eyes of the nation are fixed on their screens, the poor and the affluent alike, all eager to understand what prompted such an unexpected announcement. Constantinescu continues on, acknowledging all the challenges he faced during his presidency, reflecting on the economic and political instability the country had to endure under his tenure. From unfulfilled promises, failure to implement much needed reforms, all the while his tone is slowly becoming one of regret. As the camera captures the gravity of all his words, with the people watching intently, he stops.\n\nHe lets out a sigh, and continues:"

 romania_politics.53.t: "The King of Hearts"
 romania_politics.53.d: "With the death of King Michael I, the Romanian throne has passed down to his grandson, Prince Nicholas Medforth-Mills, now crowned as King Nicholas I. In the wake of his ascension, the young King has so far embraced a distinctive style which captivated the hearts of the Romanian people. With a warm, personable demeanor and commitment to environmental causes, he has quickly earned the affection of the massses.\n\nEschewing traditional formality, he is often seen mingling with crowds, listening to their concerns, and speaking with sincerity about his vision for a modern monarchy. No longer is he that little child holding a monarchist flag on the balcony of Hotel Continental, he is now the sovereign of 20 million beating hearts. Still, even if this thought brings him joy, his relations with the rest of the Royal Family are strained, most importantly with his aunt- Margareta.\n\nRegardless of family affairs, he has become a symbol of hope and renewal for the people. And, if you listen hard enough when passing by a school, you can hear kids sing in chorus:"

 romania_politics.54.t: "A Meeting with Duda"
 romania_politics.54.d: "Radu Duda - actor, prince and, allegedly, a Securitatea collaborator. Yeah, it is no secret that Duda isn't very popular among the common people. There is just something that he lacks: be it the charisma, looks or the never-ending discourse around him, the people just do not see him as being fit for the title of 'King-Consort'.\n\nDue to this, as much as she wants to deny it, it has become increasingly apparent to Margareta that her rule will be contested as long as Duda is a public figure. She seen the headlines, read the newspapers, heard the rumors. Thus, she invited him to a private meeting at the Elisabeta Palace, far from the public eye. And as they sat together at the dinner table, they both started to talk for an hour, maybe two.\n\nAnd as Duda left the room, the conclusion was that..."

 romania_politics.55.d.a: "With the death of King Michael I, the Romanian throne has passed down to his eldest daughter, Margareta, now crowned as Queen Margareta I. Since ascending the throne, Queen Margareta has taken her role very seriously, embracing a far different style from what was expected of her.\n\nBlunt, direct, she commands respect with her determination with her reign so far already marked by swift and decisive actions, cutting through the bureaucratic deadlock and ensuring that her vision for the monachy would take root. Having sponsored multiple learned societies and reviving the Romanian feminist movement by smashing the glass ceiling into little pieces, her unsentimental approach to governance has allowed her to move through the complex landscape of Romanian politics. No longer is she seen as aloof, with her head on some different plain of existence, now being admired by seasoned politicians and civilians alike.\n\nStill, even with all of this, trouble is still brewing. Her relations with Nicholas have never been more strained as both sides have seemingly cut all communications with one another, and the presence of Duda in the public light has a negative effect on the perceived trust the people have in the Royal Family as many wonder who truly is the iron fist behind the velvet glove.\n\nRegardless of family affairs and drama, if you listen hard enough when passing by a school, you can hear kids sing in chorus:"

 romania_politics.60.d: "With the death of King Michael I, the Romanian throne, instead of passing down to Nicholas or Margareta, has instead went to Paul. Since Michael had failed to name a clear and undisputed successor, the Crown Council, growing weary of the constant infighting within the royal family, took decisive action.\n\nDetermined to restore stability to the monarchy and the nation, the Council sought an alternative to the ongoing disputes between the factions supporting Nicholas and Margareta. Thus, they turned to Paul, an authoritative figure who had gained a following among the more traditionalist members of the Council, who saw him as the best way to preserve the integrity of the monarchy. Since ascending the throne, King Paul immediately went about consolidating his power, exiling both Nicholas and Margareta.With the danger presented by the other two contenders to the throne eliminated, Paul passed a new Constitution via a 'democratic' referendum, increasing his powers tenfold and virtually eliminating all opposition, which was anyway left in dissaray by his quick political maneuvering.\n\nRegardless of what has been or what will be, if you listen hard enough when passing by a school, you can hear kids sing in chorus:"

What was initially supposed to be a show of power, maybe even a soft self-coup, had quickly devolved into chaos as units of the Gendarmerie cracked down on the disorganized PMR supporters with tens of dozens being wounded and arrested. Quickly, the media had learnt that this March was planned and ordered by Vadim and it wasn't soon for protests to break out all across the country.\n\nVadim was forced to step down and, without political immunity, was promptly arrested and now is on trial. As the days pass on, as more and more witnesses are called to the stands, the picture of Vadim's failed insurrection becomes increasingly clear. From members of the PMR stating how everything was planned in advance, to police officers being ordered to stand down and let the march go uninterrupted, the evidence against Vadim continues to mount.\n\nAnd as the trial reaches it's last day, it became clear the Judge reached a conclusion and everyone was just waiting on the sentence to be officially delivered: 'Corneliu Vadim Tudor, this court finds you guilty of treason, incitement of inssurection, incetement of terrorism, incetement of violence, abuse of power, conscpiracy, violations of civil rights, illegal detainment and sentences you to"

 romania_politics.62.d: "In 1916, when Romania entered the Great War on the side of the Entente, Wilhelm II, furious that his own cousin Ferdinand had betrayed the family and sided with his nation, removed all mentions of him and the Romanian branch of the Hohenzollern family from the official family tree. Such was the depth of the hatred between the two branches that for decades, no reconciliation seemed possible.\n\nMuch has changed since then. The animosities of the past have gradually faded, and the political landscapes of Europe have been reshaped. With the restoration of both branches to their respective thrones, an opportunity for reconciliation had finally arisen. [ROM.GetLeader], in the hopes of bringing together the estranged branches of the family, has extended a formal invitation for the German Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] to visit Romania, the first such visit since 1917.\n\nAnd as the visit started, the streets of Bucharest were adorned with flags and curious crowds wishing to see history written before them. A reunion, more than a century in the making. And as the two monarchs met, and as the doors to the Elisabeta Palace were closed to public eyes, you could faintly hear"
