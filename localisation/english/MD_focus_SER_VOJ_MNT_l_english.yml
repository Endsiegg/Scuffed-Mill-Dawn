The central aim was to §Gestablish§! a §Ynew political unity§!: a common federal republic §Gunifying§! the §YBalkan Peninsula§! on the basis of §1internationalism§!, §Rsocialism§!, §1social solidarity§!, and §Geconomic equality§!. The underlying vision was that, despite differences among the §YBalkan peoples§!, the historical need for emancipation was a common basis for §Yunification§!.This political concept went through three phases in its development. In the §Yfirst§! phase the idea was articulated as a response to the collapse of the §YOttoman Empire§! at the §Gbeginning§! of the §Y20th century§!. In the §Ysecond phase§!, mostly through the §Rinterwar§! period (1919–1936), the idea of the §YBalkan federation§! was taken up by the §RBalkan Communist parties§!.
