 PER_resistance_economy_desc: "The sanctions placed upon us have had, unfortunately, a substantial adverse effect on the our nuclear program by making it harder to acquire specialized materials and equipment needed for the program via imports. The economic effects of sanctions have also been especially severe on our oil-dominated economy, which both relies on imports in the form of technology, and on the export of crude oil. However, we have multiple ways of attempting to decrease the effect of these sanctions, and we would be wise to implement them as quickly as possible..."

 PER_resistance_economy_2: "Conduct Oil Transactions in exchange for Gold"
 PER_resistance_economy_2_desc: "The oil sales losses [PER.GetName] is experiencing are likely to produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. Therefore, to avoid the loss of capital, we must begin to \"trade\" crude oil for another type of hard currency: Gold, which, especially with our depleting supply of Rials, seems like the next best option!"
 PER_resistance_economy_3: "Ban supply of hard currency for Luxury Good Imports"
 PER_resistance_economy_3_desc: "With our own currency reserves decreasing at a rapid rate, we have found it necessary to ban the use of Rials to purchase foreign luxury goods, even those that are widely sought by the public, such as cars and cellphones. While the public will most certainly not like this, this is a necessary measure to prevent our country from collapsing from economic woes."
 PER_resistance_economy_4: "De-Subsidize domestically sold Gasoline"

Combined with the prior information, we have been subsidizing enough oil for entire countries worth, and this must stop if we are to ever recover!"
 PER_resistance_economy_5: "Encourage Private Funds to invest in our Country"
 PER_resistance_economy_5_desc: "While the sanctions caused many companies to turn tail and run, Chinese investors have been developing our infrastructure and railways as part of their government's “One Belt, One Road” initiative. If we could negociate with the Chinese government, we may be able to attract more investors to fill up the gap left by western corporations."
 PER_resistance_economy_6: "Resist Economic Sanctions"

 PER_resistance_economy_7: "Rely on Domestic Industries"
 PER_resistance_economy_7_desc: "Many of our factories relied on foreign imports and industries to produce the necessary parts required for heavier production. Without the import of European machinery, our factories have been struggling to keep open, and many have had to shut down. However, if we open our own factories dedicated to creating machine parts, then we will no longer have to rely on the West, and the few factories left can stay open."
 PER_resistance_economy_8: "Secure Strategic Goods"
 PER_resistance_economy_8_desc: "Our military has long required mass imports of weaponry, such as the Russian S-300 SAM, as our fledgeling military-complexes have not has the necessary resources to produce these on our own. However, due to the sanctions, we are not allowed to import weaponry, and our military is becoming underequiped as older models breakdown. This requires government intervention in the form of state owned military-complexes dedicated to the production of what we are lacking in, and we will need to make our own models of SAMs, rather than relying on imports and licenses."

 PER_resistance_economy_9_desc: "From the $700 billion earned during the presidency of Ahmadinejad for the sale of oil, which ran from 2005 to 2013, $150 billion have disappeared. The \"Oil Mafia\" as it has been called, has been skimming off money from the profits, and it has been bribing government officials, leading to corruption on all tiers of the bureaucracy. To curb the Mafia's influence, we will have to prosecute and pursue any officials found to have ties with any of these corrupt oil tycoons."
 PER_resistance_economy_10: "Decrease Oil Dependency"

In West Azarbaijan, it is also believed that there is a large deposit of yellowcake uranium. The only way to get to these resources, both the gold and the uranium, is to develop the province and provide an expansion grant to the current mines and a grant for the searching of uranium deposits, as to no longer require foreign imports of rare metals."
