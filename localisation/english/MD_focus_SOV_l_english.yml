 #Russian News Events
 russia_news.1.t: "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d: "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his skeptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1: "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d: "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1: "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t: "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1: "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t: "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d: "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1: "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2: "...who?"
 russia_news.5.t: "Rise of the Soviet Union"
 russia_news.5.d: "The Russian Government has recently elected communists. It has become clear now that they wish to seek the unification of the Soviet States once more."

 russia_news.50.t: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"

The Russian Navy has publicly offered several explanations, including a collision or an attack by a NATO submarine. The NATO general secretary has already denied these allegations. The death toll stands at 118, which equals the entire crew of K-141."
 russia_news.50.o1: "A great tragedy!"
 russia_news.50.o2: "Send our condolences to our allies."
 russia_news.50.o3: "We hope the Russians will be fine."
 russia_news.50.o4: "They got what was coming to them."
 russia_news.7.t: "Russia Joins The WTO!"

Russia has had to demonstrate to the members of the WTO, especially the United States and the European Union, that it is making notable steps towards fixing its economy to competition. Russian state media hailed this event as \"a historic moment in Russian reforms and an economic recovery after the economic collapse after the USSR dissolution\"."
 russia_news.7.o1: "We're opening our doors!"
 russia_news.7.o2: "Russia opens up to the world."
 russia_news.7.o3: "Russia opens up to the world."
 russia_news.7.o4: "Curse them."
 russia_news.8.t: "Russia Renames Militsiya to Police"
 russia_news.8.d: "The law On Police was signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev quite recently as part of a full-fledged reform of law enforcement structures. The law On Police, developed as part of the reform of the Russian internal affairs bodies, provides that the militia will change its name to the police. The law defines the status, rights and duties of a police officer; frees the police from duplicating and unusual functions, strengthens the partnership model of relations between the police and society."
 russia_news.8.o1: "How interesting."
 russia_news.8.o2: "Based."

 sov_yeltsin.1.t: "Yeltsin's Legacy"
 sov_yeltsin.1.d: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the drunkard Yeltsin turned out to be the president of Russia, who could not effectively lead the country. The collapse of the USSR, the dissolution of the Supreme Council, the Chechen campaigns, loans-for-shares auctions, the denomination and default of 1998 - all this fell on the shoulders of the Russian people and crushed the hopes for a brighter future. Russia has recently chosen a president with whom it will enter the third millennium. After the difficult 1990s, there was a demand in the country for a solid and effective leader. There were hopes that after the reforms, an improvement in life would finally come. That elementary order will be put in place. And it was on Putin, who rapidly gained popularity as prime minister and acting. President, these hopes were pinned. In the 90s, after the shooting of the White House, as well as numerous disagreements in Russian society, a politician came to power who was able to consolidate all the warring parties and began to create a new political system ... What will come of it?"

At the same time, it became known about the demonstrators' attempt to break through the dense police cordon. According to Vedomosti correspondents, it was then that a Molotov cocktail flew to the police. In response, the police began to detain oppositionists breaking through the cordon and put them on buses. According to the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, despite the fact that the protesters threw dangerous objects at the police, the gas was not used against them. A law enforcement source told Vedomosti that Article 212 on inciting to riots is being tried on the organizers of the event, including Sergei Udaltsov and Alexei Navalny. So far, they are not suspects yet.

The personnel of the police and the SBU waited, there was no mass support of the locals. Quite a lot of people were really going to watch regular rallies, but there were very few people in the seized premises of the regional administration in Donetsk: they were city madmen, criminal and semi-criminal persons, pro-Russian activists, visiting Russian outcasts from the border regions. Of the entire cohort of leaders of the then DPR, only Alexander Khryakov and Andrey Purgin from the public organization Donetsk Republic, founded back in the mid-2000s, were relatively well-known. Almost everyone in Donetsk was firmly convinced that the home-grown separatists would rally for several days and disperse. However, the situation escalated sharply. Moreover, where they were not expected - in Slavyansk (population - 120 thousand at that time) in the north of the region, a detachment of armed people of 52 people entered. First of all, they seized the city police department almost without resistance.

 #Warsaw Pact Events
 Sov_warsaw_pact.1.t: "The Revival of the Warsaw Pact"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.1.d: "Our people have realized over all these years of "occupation" by the West that the times when the USSR defended fraternal Poland were beautiful and full of stability. Fate once again gives our republic a chance to once again become under the wing of Russia."
 Sov_warsaw_pact.1.a: "Let's sign a new Treaty!"

 Sov_warsaw_pact.2.t: "The Revival of the Warsaw Pact"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.2.d: "Something happened that no one expected. From the non-existence of the communist past, the Warsaw Pact has returned. The communist revolution of Poland and the pro-Russian Soviet regime established there announced the revival of this military alliance. The world is on the verge of a Cold War again."
 Sov_warsaw_pact.2.a: "May God help us"

 Sov_warsaw_pact.3.t: "Poland is Ours Again"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.3.d: "There was a pro-communist coup in Poland and a government loyal to us came to power. We have already announced the creation of a new Warsaw Pact between us and Poland, it remains only to legalize this procedure."
 Sov_warsaw_pact.3.a: "Glory of the USSR"

 Sov_warsaw_pact.4.t: "Expansion of the Warsaw Pact"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.4.d: "With the recent restoration of the Warsaw Pact, many politicians and experts have been asking the question - when will the new enlargement take place? Today, the Warsaw Pact is celebrating a new expansion of its alliance. A new Cold War has begun, and U.S. influence is slowly crumbling in eastern Europe."
 Sov_warsaw_pact.4.a: "The situation is becoming even more tense..."

 Sov_warsaw_pact.5.t: "A new ally and new opportunities"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.5.d: "Once again our diplomacy has shown its effectiveness, unlike Western diplomacy. New allies open new opportunities for our military presence in Europe and diplomatic pressure on NATO countries. We must continue our policy to secure our Superpower status forever."
 Sov_warsaw_pact.5.a: "Glory to the Soviet Union!"

 Sov_warsaw_pact.6.t: "Joining an alliance"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.6.d: "Our people have realized that the West is deceiving us. It is using methods that are destroying our independence and culture, as well as our population. We must stop this by coming under the wing of our longtime ally, the USSR. Together we can defeat this Western contagion"
 Sov_warsaw_pact.6.a: "Let's sign a new Treaty!"

 sov_warsaw_pact.9.t: "Communist uprising in East Germany"
 sov_warsaw_pact.9.d: "The situation is out of control. Our efforts to ensure stability in the country were in vain, as an uprising was launched in East Germany to create an independent GDR. With the help of the military, as well as secret financial and arms assistance from the USSR, all administrative and military buildings in the east of the country were seized. Berlin was cut off from the rest of the country. Because of the risk of being involved in a conflict with the Soviets, we are forced to conduct localized attacks on the territory of the newly formed GDR. But we can also launch a direct intervention into the zone of interest of the USSR. However, this could lead to World War III. What should we do?"
 sov_warsaw_pact.9.a: "We'll squash them like bedbugs!"

 german_proxy_war.1.t: "Successful operation!"
 german_proxy_war.1.d: "We have successfully conducted a counter-terrorist operation! The rest of the enemy army has fled."
 german_proxy_war.1.a: "The world correctly considers the German army to be one of the strongest in the world"
 german_proxy_war.2.t: "Failure of the counterterrorist operation"
 german_proxy_war.2.d: "We were unable to push back the enemy army, and were defeated. As the company becomes unprofitable, we are forced to make concessions to the other side."
 german_proxy_war.2.a: "And yet our army should be reformed."

A helicopter with 17 passengers and 3 crew members crashed at about 06:15 in the south of the Ermakovsky district, 50 km from the village of Aradan, colliding with a power line wire near the M-54 Yenisei highway, 100 km from the district center — the village of Ermakovskoye. A. Lebed died of his wounds in a hospital in Moscow. Abakan (Khakassia) 4 hours after the crash, 7 other people died besides him. According to the state commission, the cause of the disaster was "unsatisfactory preparation of the crew for the flight". It has been suggested that the cause of the disaster could have been sabotage (an explosive remotely controlled device was attached to the rotor blade), and there is also contradictory evidence that the governor ordered the crew to continue flying despite the non-flying weather, and denial of this. The lack of accurate aeronautical charts was also cited as the cause of the disaster."

 SOV_yabloko: "RUDP Yabloko"
 SOV_yabloko_desc: "Yabloko, one of the oldest liberal parties in modern Russia, finally came to power on the wave of popularity of the Western idea of democracy. Yabloko has become a haven for people who want to transform Russia into an example of a Western liberal state, including both old democrats of the 90s and young people obsessed with the idea of restructuring society."
 SOV_yavlinskiy: "Grigory Yavlinskiy"
 SOV_yavlinskiy_desc: "Grigory Yavlinsky was born April 10, 1952 in the city of Lviv, however, he began to build a career in Russia, working in the capital's soviet government structures. As a professional economist, he was appointed to implement market reforms in the USSR, but his reform plan was soon scrapped in favor of other projects. From the early 1990s to the present day he has been the head of the Yabloko party."
 SOV_russian_liberalism: "Russian Liberalism"
 SOV_russian_liberalism_desc: "Russian society has long been ruled by various dictators and tyrants. From Ivan the Terrible to the Soviet regime there was not a single period when Russia could be called a truly free democratic state. It is time to correct this! It is time to show people all the advantages of Western liberalism, with its right to self-determination and freedom of speech."
 SOV_fix_eltsyn_shit: "Fix 90s Mistakes"
 SOV_fix_eltsyn_shit_desc: "The mistakes made by the team of Gaidar and Yeltsin led to the fact that Russia has turned into an Oligarchy, sucking all the juices from the country.

 SOV_russian_free_speech: "Russian Free Speech"
 SOV_russian_free_speech_desc: "Freedom of speech is the foundation of every liberal society. When society cannot express its opinions and interests, the state closes in on itself and loses the ability to respond adequately to public demand. This is what happened under the empire, and this is what happened under the Soviet Union. The result was the collapse of countries and political chaos. It is very important to give people freedom of speech in order to prevent a new disintegration"
 SOV_no_repressions: "Reverse Repressive Laws"

 SOV_depoliticize_oligarchs_desc: "One of the mistakes made in the 90s was the emergence of an oligarchy. The economic and political elites merged and began to exploit the country as their own assets. It is necessary to depoliticize the oligarchs, so that the only one who could influence the power remained the Russian people"

We will make a plan for the reformation of society and economy that can roll back the societal values of the past and introduce the liberal values of the future. Our plan to build a Great Society can be compared to Lyndon B. Johnson's plan, but ours is aimed at a complete reorganization of society and the economy."
 SOV_capitalism_in_500_days: "Start 500 Days Program"
 SOV_capitalism_in_500_days_desc: "Building a Great Society also requires us to restructure our economy. The 500 Days program was created for this indirect purpose.

 SOV_kill_communists_desc: "Some of the most important opponents of liberalism and market economics are communists.

These bacteria must be fought with all possible methods, so that the system can function properly in the future."

 SOV_more_fair_taxation: "Fair Taxation"
 SOV_more_fair_taxation_desc: "The main problem with our system is the issue of taxation of the regions. Now all taxes are collected first to the regional centers and later to the federal one. As a result, the federal center distributes all the money and, of course, most of the money goes to the center or important regions, while everyone else remains poor. In order to prevent economic inequality and separatism, we must reform our system so that the regions can dispose of funds themselves, this will ensure equal development of the regions."

 SOV_empower_duma: "Empower Federal Assembly"
 SOV_empower_duma_desc: "The powers possessed by the President of the Russian Federation may not be extensive, but in fact his position as an independent office creates an ideal condition for usurping power in the country by influencing the three main branches of government.

We are being asked to radically change our system of government authority. Allegedly, it is not democratic, creates dictatorship, etc. However, the Constitution 93 is actually one of the freest in the world, because the authors took as a basis the constitutions of the most liberal countries of the West.

In order for the federation to function fully and develop evenly, it is necessary to reduce the dependence of the regions on the federal center. In this way we will achieve equality between the regions.."
 SOV_real_welfare: "A Real Social Welafare"
 SOV_real_welfare_desc: "Reforming the welfare system is a priority of our Government. For too long, the common man has suffered from failed market reforms and crooked social insurance.  We will reform social security and improve the lives of our citizens."
 SOV_empower_legislature: "Inheritor of Russian Constituent Assembly"
 SOV_empower_legislature_desc: "The Russian Constituent Assembly was the first truly popular assembly that was to determine the future of the country and its people and had it not been for the Bolsheviks, the Constituent Assembly could have been a true people's parliament. The goal of becoming such a people's assembly was the creation of the State Duma as the lower house of the Federal Assembly. However, during the entire existence of the State Duma, it completely discredited itself and lost that unifying symbol of the people's will and unification. The time has come to restore confidence in the Duma by vesting it with real powers and ensuring real popular representation."
 SOV_defend_people: "Defend Our People"
 SOV_defend_people_desc: "It hurts us to see a single mother collecting the last change for her child's medicine. It pains us to see a large family taking out a loan at an incredibly high interest rate to afford a one-room apartment. It pains us to see poverty spreading region by region. Thousands of citizens are left on the brink of poverty while banks and companies only get richer. To defeat this injustice, we must first create a system of benefits and social guarantees that can protect citizens from living in poverty."
 SOV_social_gurantees: "Social Gurantees and Healthcare"
 SOV_social_gurantees_desc: "The main challenge for the Russian social security system is pension provision and a broken health care system. The old generation cannot afford medicines because of high prices, and a seriously ill person who goes to the hospital risks not returning from it. We must provide pensioners with good conditions and the health care system with subsidies and funding."
 SOV_a_just_system: "A Just System"
 SOV_a_just_system_desc: "We aim to create a system in which everyone is someone, in which all basic human rights are guaranteed, in which political participation is encouraged, and in which truly fair decisions are made at fair elections.

 SOV_a_just_economy_desc: "Our fondest wish is to see not only a prosperous economy, but also a prosperous nation. Every person should be financially secure and socially protected, no one should be left at a broken trough! This is the only way we can build a prosperous country. And in this way companies and taxes from excessive profits will help, the rich should pay more and the poor less. In this way we will achieve equality and social justice in society. Forward to a Just Economy!"
 SOV_question_of_direction: "Question of Direction"
 SOV_question_of_direction_desc: "The question of the direction of our party has become acute. There is a group that believes that the social reforms carried out are not radical enough, they position the party and themselves not as a moderately reformist, but radical organization which goal is to transform the current social order. Others believe that we should take an example from the European social democratic parties, as their ideas are effective and relevant. It is up to us to decide where the party will go and who will win."
 SOV_revive_spirit_of_socialist_revolutionaries: "Revive the Spirit of Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 SOV_revive_spirit_of_socialist_revolutionaries_desc: "The Socialists-Revolutionaries was an organization and later a party that set itself the goal of radical transformation of Russian society on the basis of the ideas of agrarian socialism. They believed that the main engine of the revolution should be the peasants, on their shoulders a real first democratic and later socialist society should be built. Although A Just Russia did not claim to be the heirs of the SRs, the transformations we carried out launched a process of peaceful but still radical transformation of society, even revolutionary in some respects. Although the ideas of the Social Revolutionaries were created two centuries ago, they are still relevant today. So why don't we declare ourselves the successors of the SRs and officially announce the reestablishment of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party?"
 SOV_land_socialisation: "The Land Socialisation"
 SOV_land_socialisation_desc: "The main point of the program of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party was the socialization of land. According to the program, the land should belong to all the people of Russia and everyone has the right to use it. In fact, this means the transfer of land into state hands. However, we are representatives of the interests of the people and we will be able to dispose of it fairly and to the maximum benefit of the people."
 SOV_social_democracy_sr: "Social Democracy Still in Fashion"
 SOV_social_democracy_sr_desc: "Social democracy is probably one of the most effective ideas that originated in Europe. History knows a great number of successful examples of practical application of European social democracy. By adopting this experience we will be able to carry out successful reforms to improve the lives of our citizens in the future."
 SOV_third_way: "The Third Way"
 SOV_third_way_desc: "One of the characteristics of a democratic regime is the need for constant negotiation and balance. Many social democratic regimes have long gone from traditionally leftist ideas to more market-oriented but efficient ones. Such economic changes have been called the Third Way. Such economic ideas are characterized by a combination of traditionally market-oriented economic practices and social democratic ideas, creating a symbiosis of left-right practices to balance all. These are exactly the kind of ideas that are relevant and effective for us."
 SOV_centre_holds: "The Centre Stayed Strong"
 SOV_centre_holds_desc: "The agenda of the party's Central Council was stronger. The congress adopted by a majority of votes a patriotic program that envisages strengthening Russia's sovereignty, the authority of the central government and the people's unification around the government. This is the program of transforming Russia from a backward collapsed country into a strong superpower capable of protecting its borders and its multinational people!"

 SOV_empower_nation: "Empower the Russian People"
 SOV_empower_nation_desc: "For us, the Russian nation is not only the nation of Russians, it is all the inhabitants of the vast territories of Russia. The peoples of the Volga region, Siberia, and the Caucasus are all part of the Russian nation, they are bearers of Russian identity, speak the Russian language, and share similar cultural traditions and values. It is this nation that should be dominant in Russia, only they should have priority for the state, because it is their interests that it represents. And not a single foreigner dare to claim their special rights, Russia is a country only for the multinational Russian people!"
 SOV_talks_with_rodina: "Talks with Rodina"
 SOV_talks_with_rodina_desc: "We share a long history of relations with the Rodina Faction. In the early 2000s, we were a single party, but as a result of internal contradictions, first the Duma faction broke up, and then a number of organizations left Rodina, which later formed Just Russia. Now the contradictions have subsided, and our political programs are virtually indistinguishable from each other, so the logical step would be to establish relations and unite to effectively implement our policies."

 SOV_form_national_patriotic_front_desc: "Russian man, though strong in body and soul, but alone is vulnerable to the enemy, but united, the Russian people can turn back the rivers and topple mountains.

 SOV_more_regulations_desc: "For too long the capitalists have exploited our people and state. Their activities have not brought any benefit to society, all the money goes only to them without giving anything in return. No wonder, because liberal legislation has completely unleashed the capitalists. We will nationalize all big business and create a network of state corporations so that we can direct the market in the direction we want."

We will start militarization of the economy and popularization of the army among the population.

 SOV_under_a_leader_desc: "The traditions of Russian state power are such that it has always been built on the figure of a strong leader. Ivan the Terrible, Alexander the Third, Joseph Stalin - these are all great leaders around whom the system of state power was built. Also, these are exactly the historical figures for whom the Russian people have the greatest respect. Now both people and the state system need the figure of a strong leader around whom people are ready to rally to achieve a great goal and we are ready to give it to them!"

 SOV_talks_with_left_patriots_desc: "Gennady Semigin's Patriots of Russia is a major player in the political arena, his party has a lot of popular support and financial assets. This party advocates a similar program of left-wing patriotism as ours. It would be foolish to overlook such an obvious ally. We will start negotiations with Patriots of Russia to join the National Patriotic Front and subsequently give them a seat in the government."
 SOV_unite_patriotic_parties: "Unite Patriotic Parties"
 SOV_unite_patriotic_parties_desc: "The disintegration of the Rodina party resulted in the emergence of a huge number of small parties sharing similar ideas of patriotism.

At the moment, the State Duma is in complete anarchy, no political force has any constructive majority and, as a consequence, each political force is trying to get some influence on decision-making. At the regional level, party fragmentation plays only into the hands of regional elites, providing the parliaments of the subjects with greater freedom from the federal center.\n At the moment there are three forces to work with: the Unity Party loyal to our government, the Fatherland - All Russia bloc, and the Our Home - Russia loyal reformist party.\n We have two options on how to work with them. Either we will enlarge the current pro-government factions in Duma and create a large coalition out of this parties, giving them a certain niche, or we will unite them into a giant \"Party of Power\". In the first case, we will preserve a certain degree of democracy, in the second case we will ensure greater centralization of power."
