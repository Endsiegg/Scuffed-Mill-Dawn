 SOV_attack_chechnya: "Grozny Offensive"
 SOV_attack_chechnya_desc: "The Second Chechen War begun in August of 1999, when Chechen fighters, whose state, Ichkeria, enjoyed de facto independence since the First Chechen War of 1996, began with a large-scale military infiltration of the neighboring Dagestan province. The Russian military's retaliation has resulted in a siege of the Chechen capital city of Grozny. The city is likely to fall by late January or early February."
 SOV_presidential_election_of_2000: "The 2000 Elections"
 SOV_presidential_election_of_2000_desc: "The era of Boris Yeltsin ended on 31 December 1999, when he de facto passed power to his designated political heir, Vladimir Putin. Putin, with fresh support from the victory over the Chechens, now aims to fortify his political legitimacy with a Presidential Election in March 2000."
 SOV_putin: "Putin"
 SOV_putin_desc: "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born 1952) is Boris Yeltsin's designated political heir and by far the favorite to win the election. His political activity started in the secret service, when he operated in what was then East Germany for the Soviet KGB. In the Russian Federation, he first became director of the Federal Security Service in 1998 and was then named Deputy Prime Minister under Yeltsin in August 1999."
 SOV_zhirinovsky: "Zhirinovsky"
 SOV_zhirinovsky_desc: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky (born 1946) has been the leader of the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party of Russia since 1991. Well known, among other things, for a juice fight with centrist politician Boris Nemtsov in 1995, Zhirinovsky stands for belligerent and rash policies. One of his proposals is to contaminate the NATO-aligned Baltic states by blowing airborne radioactive waste across the border."
 SOV_zyuganov: "Zyuganov"
 SOV_zyuganov_desc: "Gennady Zyuganov (born 1944) is the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation since 1993. In 1996, Zyuganov had been the favorite to win the Presidential Election against Boris Yeltsin, but then flaundered the early lead and lost in the second round with 40.7% of the vote versus Yeltsin's 54.4%. Politically, Zyuganov holds positions of left wing nationalism."
 SOV_yavlinsky: "Yavlinsky"
 SOV_yavlinsky_desc: "Grigory Yavlinsky (born 1952), formerly active in the economic restructuring of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s as the author of the \"500 Days Programme\", is the leader of the social liberal Yabloko coalition. He received 7.3% of the vote in 1996. His support is strongest with urban and middle class voters and his diplomatic policy is amicable towards the western powers."
 #Vladimir Poutine
 SOV_empower_putins_cronies: "Empower Putin's Cronies"
 SOV_empower_putins_cronies_desc: "In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a lot of previously state-owned companies were privatized. An elite class of businessmen, known collectively as the 'oligarchs', became very rich very quickly by buying those corporations at the cheapest of prices and capitalizing on the subsequent economic profits. These oligarchs are now closely aligned with the Yeltsin and Putin administrations."
 SOV_fight_corruption: "Fight Corruption"
 SOV_fight_corruption_desc: "Instead of continuing Yeltsin's policy of aiding and abetting the oligarchs, Putin should instead attempt to stifle their influence, re-nationalize key industries and increase workplace democracy and industrial government oversight. This would hurt relations with the oil and gas industries and would turn away western investors, but it would fight the rampant corruption in Russian public life."
 SOV_gazprom: "New GazProm Synthetics"
 SOV_gazprom_desc: "Gazprom (a portmanteau of Gazovaya Promyshlennost, 'gas industry') was founded in 1989 to serve as the Russian state's prime corporation in the business of the production and sale of natural gas resources. It has since also become the world's single largest producer of oil, and serves as the Russian Federation's single strongest supplier of natural resources to the domestic and international market."
 SOV_weaken_the_oligarchs: "Weaken the Oligarchs"
 SOV_weaken_the_oligarchs_desc: "After publicly disavowing the programs of Anatoly Chubais under the Yeltsin administration and after announcing the government's campaign against corrupt and greedy individuals, it is now time to systematically weed out the influence of powerful and well-connected businessmen in the Russian government."
 SOV_secure_putins_position: "Secure Putin's Positions"
 SOV_secure_putins_position_desc: "After making local and federal alliances with the CPRF and Zyuganov's poor performance in the 2000 election, United Russia can now drive CPRF out of the political process. This will, in the long term, eliminate the communist and neo-Soviet sympathizers as a serious political threat to Putin. After that is completed, the 'two-party system' that Zyuganov envisioned will have become a system of one."
 SOV_nationalize_oligarch_factories: "Nationalize Oligarch Factories"
 SOV_nationalize_oligarch_factories_desc: "The likes of Leonid Mikhelson of gas giant Novatek, Vladimir Lisin of steel conglomerate Novolipetsk and Vagit Alekperov of oil company LUKOIL are examples of Russian oligarchs that enriched themselves in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union's economic collapse. Such companies, especially in heavy industry and natural resource production, must go back into the public hand."
 SOV_moscow_military_factories: "Moscow Arms Production"
 SOV_moscow_military_factories_desc: "A large amount of Russian defense companies are located in the Moscow region, including aircraft manufacturers Sukhoi and Mikoyan as well as the JSC Kalashnikov group, producer of the series of Russian standard-issue assault rifles in use with the Soviet and Russian Armed Forces since the early 1950s. These corporations, vital to Russia's national defense, are too important to allow them to fail."
 SOV_republican_industrial_project: "Republican Industrial Project"
 SOV_republican_industrial_project_desc: "The late 1990s left Russia in one of its most severe economic crises in modern history. Unemployment is rampant and there is widespread crushing poverty that resulted from the post-Soviet period of rapid privatization and mass emigration of companies and high-quality employees to the west. The 2000s must be better, and civilian industry must be strengthened for domestic and international commerce."
 SOV_take_control_of_the_justice_system: "Influence the Justice System"
 SOV_take_control_of_the_justice_system_desc: "With the 2001 Amendment Law of the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation, Putin officially aimed to introduce stricter oversight and quality control of regional and local judges, with the intent to crack down on corrupt judicial clerks left after the turbulent 1990s. As a useful side effect, Putinist interference in the Russian justice system will leave the domestic intelligence community in charge of most of it."
 SOV_republican_military_project: "Republican Military Project"
 SOV_republican_military_project_desc: "After the expansion of the arms companies in Moscow, it is now essential to expand the benefits of the Russian arms industry to the provinces. There, Russian military contractors will be able to find more space to conduct military tests than they do in underground test facilities in urban areas. However, it is first necessary to supply these regions with talented individuals to aid in this endeavor."
 SOV_education_reform: "Russian Education"
 SOV_education_reform_desc: "While the secluded education system of Soviet Union had been mostly sufficient for the USSR's interests, the liberalization of Russia and the public access to information from the west showcased to the Russian public how far behind the education system really was behind western counterparts. The Putin administration made it one of its key policy goals to improve the quality of Russia's education system."
 SOV_st_petersburg_military_factories: "St. Petersburg Military Factories"
 SOV_st_petersburg_military_factories_desc: "While Moscow is the center of Russia's defense industry, the Federal City of St Petersburg and the Oblast of Leningrad that surrounds it are the country's secondary population center and home to some 7 million people. St Petersburg is full of untapped potential for Russia's defense industry and could supply the Russian manufacturers with many high-skill laborers."
 SOV_take_control_of_local_administrations: "Greased Palms Make Light Work"
 SOV_take_control_of_local_administrations_desc: "United Russia, in its overarching goal of forming Russia into a unified national interest bloc that can enforce a strong and assertive domestic and foreign policy agenda, is intolerant of opposition and local political activism against the government, especially from outside the party."
 SOV_oppress_the_opposition: "Oppress the Opposition"
 SOV_oppress_the_opposition_desc: "Although United Russia has in the past allied with the CPRF and some centrist forces to further its own agenda, the communists, centrists, and LDPR have at some point become little but a nuisance. While there officially wouldn't be a ban on opposition parties, their activism and organization must be disturbed at every turn to the point that United Russia's own candidates are overbearingly favored in any contest."
 SOV_encourage_industrial_growth: "Stimulate Industrial Growth"
 SOV_encourage_industrial_growth_desc: "With the federal government's control strengthened and local voices of dissent less likely to stir up trouble, more parts of Russia's wide open spaces and more of its diverse and numerous population can be used to further the goal of Russian economic growth and recovery from the recession of the 1990s."
 SOV_aggressive_foreign_policy: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 SOV_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc: "With the home front secured from internal opposition and whiners, Russia can now ramp up saberrattling and outwardly belligerent rhetoric. At the forefront of any Russian foreign policy position needs to stand the protection of exiled ethnic Russian populations that could provide pretexts for influence, intervention or invasion of sovereign third parties."
 SOV_encourage_military_production: "Russian Weapon Manufacturing"
 SOV_encourage_military_production_desc: "With an economic recovery from our civilian crisis underway, the government needs to encourage the military industry to, even if just for a moment, live beyond its means and overproduce military equipment to further encourage foreign enthusiasm over profit potentials in Russia's domestic defense industries. As a useful side effect, our armed forces would also gain a lot of guns from that."
 SOV_the_dictatorship: "New Russian Autocracy"
 SOV_the_dictatorship_desc: "It is no longer necessary to play to the fiddle of supposed parliamentary democratic values. Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Medvedev and their United Russia know better than their so-called political rivals, and it is no longer a needed aspect of Russian political life to have the populous weigh political visions against one another. Putin knows the way. Let him lead. Forever."
 ##Putin-Zhirinovsky Shared Tree
 SOV_russian_national_interests: "Russia's National Interests"
 SOV_russian_national_interests_desc: "The Russian political right, initially in disarray after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, has organized around strong foreign policy goals in the late 1990s. Closer ties with Lukashenko's Belarus, a strong influence on Ukraine for the purpose of ethnic Russian security and Russian naval interests, and the removal of Georgia's overreach in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
 SOV_undermine_georgia: "Undermine Georgia"
 SOV_undermine_georgia_desc: "The Russian foreign intelligence agency SVR RF must see itself into the Republic of Georgia and undermine the Georgian military and political apparatus with Russian informants to enable the government to predict Georgia's diplomatic and political maneuvers, specifically in regards to Russia's protectorates in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
 SOV_annex_abkhazia_and_south_ossetia: "Integrate Abkhazia and South Ossetia"
 SOV_annex_abkhazia_and_south_ossetia_desc: "Georgia's meddling in Abkhazia and South Ossetia is too dangerous to be left unpunished. It is absolutely necessary for the sake of the ethnic Russians in the region that Georgia's military is kept at bay and that the 'sovereignity' of Abkhazia and South Ossetia (in Russia's shadow) is preserved."
 SOV_2008_military_reforms: "2008 Military Overhaul"
 SOV_2008_military_reforms_desc: "The Russian military, still logistically in shambles since the collapse and fracturing of the Soviet Red Army, is a bloated and ineffective fighting force that has proven more than flawed, including a humiliating defeat in the First Chechen War of 1996. A Russian government task force around Anatoly Serdyukov have made ambitious plans to reform the Russian forces, especially the Russian officer corps."
 SOV_reassure_belarus: "Reassure Belarus"
 SOV_reassure_belarus_desc: "Since the 1998 \"Treaty on Equal Rights of Citizens\", Russia and Belarus, known as the binational 'Union State' since 1996, have formed strong political, economic and social ties. Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko, often called 'Europe's last dictator', has been an unsure actor that fled from western encroachment into the Russian embrace. It is necessary to maintain the mutually beneficial relationship."
 SOV_tighten_the_union_state: "Tighten the Union State"
 SOV_tighten_the_union_state_desc: "The 1996 Union State between Russian and Belarus attempted to remove trade barriers and cultural divisions between the two parties, but it made the critical error of setting them both as equals. Russia, as the natural protective power of all of Eastern Europe, must keep close tabs on Belarussian policy to prevent them from slipping into any foolish pro-western mindset."
 SOV_pressure_ukraine: "Strongarm Ukraine"
 SOV_pressure_ukraine_desc: "The name 'Ukraine' is descended from a word that literally translates to 'borderland'. The Ukrainian people live in the believe of independence, but their cultural and geographical existence is ultimately dependent on the Russians, their more important and more powerful neighbor. Ukraine is important to maintain as part of the Russian sphere."
 SOV_condemn_ukrainian_russophobes: "Condemn Ukrainian Russophobes"
 SOV_condemn_ukrainian_russophobes_desc: "Recent political changes in Ukraine have made it clear that the Kiev government does not intend to respect the ancient bond between Russia and her Okraina, 'borderland'. To make sure that our turnabout in policy towards Ukraine doesn't cause any backlash among the Russian population, we need to first shift gears in diplomatic rhetoric towards them. Perhaps, a few incidents could also be fabricated."
 SOV_demand_belarussian_annexation: "Federalize the Union State"
 SOV_demand_belarussian_annexation_desc: "The Union State, which had been thought dead by some of its critics, can now go into the final stage - an actual union. Belarus will surely be glad to join the Russian Federation in the form of the Minsk, Grodno and Gomel Oblasts. This is the logical conclusion of the Lukashenko policy towards Russia and should hopefully not be surprising to Belarussian policy makers."
 SOV_take_crimea: "Seize Crimea"
 SOV_take_crimea_desc: "While we consider the best option against Ukraine, it is vital to seize Crimea, an ethnically Russian and strategically important peninsula across the Sea of Azov from Novorossiysk, with a quick and sudden show of force. The troops that will be deployed to instigate and \"assist\" a local insurrection against Ukrainian governance shall be unmarked to give Russia plausible deniability in the matter. If we delay the clarity of our troops, that should prevent a sudden western intervention altogether."
 SOV_southern_defensive_option: "Southern Defensive Option"
 SOV_southern_defensive_option_desc: "Instead of pursuing further aggression against Ukraine, we should instead go south to annoy Georgia."
 SOV_the_novorossiyan_uprising: "The Novorossiyan Uprising"
 SOV_the_novorossiyan_uprising_desc: "With Crimea secure, the people of Luhansk and Donezk in the east of the Ukrainian mainland demand their own Russian ethnic sovereignity. With some \"covert\" action, the Russian military could assist these self-liberation movements."
 SOV_annex_novorossiya: "Annex Novorossiya"
 SOV_annex_novorossiya_desc: "Novorossiya, or 'New Russia', is the collective term for regions in eastern and southern Ukraine that are mainly populated by ethnic Russians. The Novorossiyans were indifferent to what Soviet Republic they lived under during the times of the USSR, but they were torn from their homeland after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now, they are no longer happy in independent Ukraine. That is unacceptable."
 SOV_demand_baltic_loyalty: "Demand Baltic Loyalty"
 SOV_demand_baltic_loyalty_desc: "In the 1940s, the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were strongarmed into membership in the Soviet Union after brief stints with independence between the 1920s and 1930s. Although a similar attempt by the Soviet Union to convince Finland of its noble intentions ended up somewhat backfiring, it can not be denied that Baltic membership in Russia was hugely beneficial. For Russia, that is."
 SOV_settle_the_estonian_question: "Settle the Estonian Question"
 SOV_settle_the_estonian_question_desc: "More than 300,000 ethnic Russians call Estonia their home, primarily in the Harju and Ida-Viru counties close to the Russian border. Overall, ethnic Russians make up for about a quarter of Estonia's population, and they are group of our people now forced into all kinds of humiliating memberships in western-infected organizations like NATO and the European Union. This question needs to be settled."
 SOV_settle_the_latvian_question: "Settle the Latvian Question"
 SOV_settle_the_latvian_question_desc: "Almost a million Russians were left in Latvia after the collapse of the USSR. While around half of this group left Latvia since, about 500,000 Russians are left in Riga's yoke. Still, this equals about a quarter of the Latvian population and, next to Estonia, marks yet another part of the Russian people that were driven from political association with their rightful homeland by western interference. That is unacceptable."
 SOV_attack_lithuania: "Attack Lithuania"
 SOV_attack_lithuania_desc: "After having settled the issues of ethnic Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia, it is now in order to, in a more overt move of aggression, connect the Kaliningrad Oblast with the Russian mainland. The small country that stands in the way is Lithuania, which broke away from the USSR in 1991 and has since heavily aligned with the western powers, along with its Baltic brethren."
 SOV_attack_finland: "Fabricate some more incidents in Finland"
 SOV_attack_finland_desc: "In the winter of 1938/1939, Finland cowardly attacked the Soviet Union in what were definitely unstaged and genuine military attacks against Soviet soldiers that were innocently standing around. While the USSR managed to establish a protective barrier of new territories against the evil Finnish menace, it is clear that his lowly people cannot be trusted. Ceterum censeo Finnoniam esse delendam."
 SOV_attack_poland: "Yet another Partition"
 SOV_attack_poland_desc: "Us Russians are a people who learn from history: If at first we don't succeed, partition Poland, partition Poland, partition Poland again."
 SOV_attack_sweden: "War Plan Sweden"
 SOV_attack_sweden_desc: "While it will be really hard to justify an attack against Sweden, it is probably safe to say that no one likes those Surströmming-gobbling Viking wannabes and their pickled hering anyway. We'll just stroll by with some tanks and trust that no one cares. Let's go, boys."
 SOV_attack_germany: "End German Hegemony"
 SOV_attack_germany_desc: "Otto von Bismarck in his time attempted at all costs to avoid wars between Germany and Russia, but since then, the Germans have shown up on Russia's doorstep again and again and again. The German people, ever industrious, vicious and without humor, cannot be trusted to respect Russia's eternal claim to its destiny. As a result, they must be destroyed."
 #Zhirinovsky
 SOV_arrest_zyuganov: "Arrest Zyuganov"
 SOV_arrest_zyuganov_desc: "Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the communists since 1993, is one of the LDPR's most committed and dangerous critics and political rivals. To prepare the strike against the CPRF, the LDPR needs to first remove Zyuganov from the picture. Zyuganov's arrest under some random pretext is important to decapitate the communist movement and deny it political direction."
 SOV_political_purges: "Political Purges"
 SOV_political_purges_desc: "After defeating the moderate conservatives and Yeltsin's little lapdog, the LDPR must make sure that the Russian people no longer see them as any sort of viable alternative to the future vision endorsed by Zhirinovsky and his peers. For that, local administrators, judges, council clerks, mayors, police chiefs and university professors friendly to the Yeltsin regime must be weeded out."
 SOV_crush_the_communists: "Crush the Communists"
 SOV_crush_the_communists_desc: "The Communist Party is a decadent and shameful stain on Russian history. It emerged from insurrectionist rabble that was unwilling to accept their rightful place in society, and it will remain a permanent threat to the LDPR position of power in Russia. Only the altogether removal of communist influence from the Russian political landscape can help."
 SOV_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 SOV_increase_military_spending_desc: "The military is the most important organization of any self-respecting state. The Russian military, traditionally full of a nationalistic class of young officers, could be the most important pillar for the Zhirinovsky administration - if only they can be convinced to be loyal to the new government. An increase in military spending will increase domestic stability and military quality."
 SOV_hyper_nationalism: "Hyper Nationalism"
 SOV_hyper_nationalism_desc: "Through the total submission of the individual to the national collective, the collective can gain strength, power, and standing in the world. Russian children need to be taught from an early age that their purpose is to serve Russia, and that Russia must be preserved at all cost, even at the cost of the life of any given Russian. Except for LDPR leaders of course, they will remain in their offices, safe and sound."
 SOV_punish_yeltsins_cronies: "Punish Yeltsin's Cronies"
 SOV_punish_yeltsins_cronies_desc: "With society increasingly in line with the Zhirinovsky administration's political agenda, the political and economic elites are next to be tackled. The oligarchs, a dangerous class that got rich during the privatization of post-Soviet Russian corporations, must be subjugated and forced into the new system. Those who submit will remain in their posts, and those who resist will be put on lists."
 SOV_revoke_personal_freedoms: "Revoke Personal Freedoms"
 SOV_revoke_personal_freedoms_desc: "Although such moves cannot be made in the open just yet, the LDPR must see to the subversion of the Russian justice system to prevent the government from being held up by individual opponents and critics in the courts. By placing loyal adherents of the Zhirinovsky agenda in key positions of judicial and legislative power, the courts could potentially be eliminated as a threat to government power."
 SOV_execute_the_oligarchs: "Hunt down disloyal Oligarchs"
 SOV_execute_the_oligarchs_desc: "It is now time to use the aforementioned lists of oligarchs who either privately or publicly worked against our regime, and to either drive these subversive elements out of the country, or, if possible, to remove them from their bothersome status as living individuals altogether. It will look suspicious, especially to those oligarchs who tried to remain loyal, but it is a necessary step."
 SOV_persecute_minorities: "Persecute Minorities"
 SOV_persecute_minorities_desc: "We live in a society."
 SOV_the_end_of_the_republic: "End of the Republic"
 SOV_the_end_of_the_republic_desc: "With Russia a police state with a population under constant nationalist indoctrination, it is now time to make tabula rasa and to put our cards on the table. The liberal experiment of 1991 has failed. It is not in the Russian's character to embrace a pluralistic, democratic or individualistic society. These are western ideas. The Russian prospers as part of a powerful machine. Russia is that machine."
 SOV_encourage_foreign_cheap_laborers: "Encourage Foreign Cheap Labor"
 SOV_encourage_foreign_cheap_laborers_desc: "While we are dealing with the minority problems in Chechnya, Dagestan and other troublesome regions, it is still important to keep our factories running at all costs. Underhandedly, away from the public eye, we need to encourage guest workers from neighboring countries that are economically inferior to Russia. These guest workers will be strictly supervised and kept separate from Russian society."
 SOV_dictatorial_coup: "Dictatorial Coup"
 SOV_dictatorial_coup_desc: "While suggestions have been made that Zhirinovsky aims to crown himself the new Tsar of the Russians, our glorious leader is less than interested in such matters. He is much more like Julius Caesar, the man that the title of 'Tsar' is named after. He rose through the ranks of politics to liberate the nation from its own baggage of democracy and consensus votes."
 SOV_claim_the_crown: "Claim the Crown"
 SOV_claim_the_crown_desc: "The Revolution of 1917, a product of the vile subversive communists and their Jewish overlords, threw Russia into its deepest national crisis of all time. The execution of the Romanovs, an honorable and patriotic ruling family, marked the beginning of unstable republicanism and evil meddling by foreign forces. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who will become Russia's next Tsar, is the man born to fix all these problems."
 SOV_reinforce_the_one_party_state: "Reinforce the One Party State"
 SOV_reinforce_the_one_party_state_desc: "After the recent political turmoil, it is perhaps best to inform the Russian people that everything is well and good. After all, this state is not too dissimilar from previous iterations of the Russian government, and the liberal phase of the 1990s produced nothing but trouble anyway. A One Party State, this time run by the rightly guided Zhirinovsky administration, is best for Russia."
 SOV_ensure_military_loyalty: "Ensure Military Loyalty"
 SOV_ensure_military_loyalty_desc: "With the recent political makeover of Russian society, it is now in order to ensure that the Russian military, so far a good and faithful supporter of the Zhirinovsky movement, has remained committed to the cause. We expect no issues, and with a few administrative replacements at the top of the army, we should be able to secure the domestic and foreign safety of Russia."
 SOV_honor_the_romanovs: "Honor the Romanovs"
 SOV_honor_the_romanovs_desc: "Zhirinovsky's self-coronation, almost Napoleonic in nature, is bound to ruffle a few feathers with most Russians who have bad memories of Soviet-style authoritarian government. It is best to paint over public association with the Soviet dictators and to instead stress the continuity between the Zhirinovsky monarchy and the deposed Romanov dynasty that was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in 1917."
 SOV_secure_kazakhstan: "Secure Kazakhstan"
 SOV_secure_kazakhstan_desc: "While outright annexation of Kazakhstan is perhaps unnecessary - the inclusion of too many Muslims in the Russian nation is bound to be toxic for the country's ethnic health -, the self-driven and insubordinate spirit of the Kazakh people might lead them to turn against their current alliance with the Russian state. To prevent this, the Kazakh government needs to be purged of anti-Russian elements."
 SOV_ambitions_in_central_asia: "Central Asian Ambitions"
 SOV_ambitions_in_central_asia_desc: "Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Strangecountrystan, Kyrgyzstan, Whogivesadamnistan, Uzbekistan and all the other Stans are unnecessary additions to the world map as independent diplomatic actors. We wouldn't want any of these countries to align with any of our enemies. They must be reined in before they can act against us."
 SOV_secure_the_grand_duchy: "Secure the Grand Duchy"
 SOV_secure_the_grand_duchy_desc: "Finland's independence was one of Russia history's most regrettable missteps. The Finns are a vile people full of malice that are only waiting for the best opportunity to backstab innocent Russia and to take rightful Russian territories in Kola and Karelia. Against the overwhelming threat of the dangerous Finnish state against the peace-loving Russian people, a preventive war is the only solution."
 ##Zyuganov
 SOV_fight_international_capitalists: "Fight International Capitalists"
 SOV_fight_international_capitalists_desc: "The oligarchs are a dangerous and corrupt class, no better than the kulaks of Soviet times. Since the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian oligarchs have gobbled up more and more economic influence and driven Russian workers out of jobs, in favor of a globalistic economic model powered by foreign companies. To revive Russia, it is first essential to drive out the international capitalist class."
 SOV_mobilize_the_masses: "Mobilize the Masses"
 SOV_mobilize_the_masses_desc: "A revolution cannot be carried by a vanguard party alone. The CPRF needs to win the hearts and minds of Russian workers and farmers to mobilize them for the revolutionary efforts and to get them engaged politically and economically. There needs to be a large scale effort to employ Russia's unemployed, to renovate its factories and to accelerate the construction of new labor collectives."
 SOV_weaken_the_banks: "Weaken the Banks"
 SOV_weaken_the_banks_desc: "Banks are the praetorian guard of capitalism, carrying its banner into combat and defending its profits with their very existence. They meddle in poor areas of the world, abuse the working class with wage dumping and interest speculations, and they influence politics with both legal and illegal donations. Banks must be returned to a state in which they are mere apolitical short term money lenders."
 SOV_crackdown_on_nationalists: "Crackdown on Nationalists"
 SOV_crackdown_on_nationalists_desc: "While the Soviet Union at times used nationalism to great effect, for example when calling upon the Russian spirit against Poland in 1920 or when waging a 'Great Patriotic War' against Germany in 1941, it must ultimately be recognized that the nationalistic chauvinist is not good for communism. While healthy patriotism shall remain in every communist, nationalism must be crushed."
 SOV_the_fifth_international: "The Fifth International"
 SOV_the_fifth_international_desc: "The Soviet communist movement had a rift open up between proponents of the Stalinist Third International and the eventual Trotzkyist Fourth International beginning in the early 1920s. This rift was driven to a bloody climax when the USSR started purging proponents of Trotzkyism, up to and including the prospect for natural resources via ice pick in Leon Trotzky's skull. We need a new international."
 SOV_five_year_plans: "Five Year Plans"
 SOV_five_year_plans_desc: "The free economic models of the western states is no future for a socialist state. The return to planned economy, preferably in the form of classical Soviet-style Five Year Plans, will give the government unchecked influence on the previously unchecked economy."
 SOV_crackdown_on_liberals: "Crackdown on Liberals"
 SOV_crackdown_on_liberals_desc: "Remember, comrades, the liberal is just a fascist in disguise, for when you cut a liberal, a fascist bleeds. Whenever the liberal has to pick between sacrificing his economic rights in the name of the collective or sacrificing his personal rights on the altars of fascism, he will always prefer his economic status over his personal liberty. Get wrecked, liberal."
 SOV_empower_the_communist_party: "Empower the Communist Party"
 SOV_empower_the_communist_party_desc: "Calling back to the legacy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the role of 'Vanguard Party' as per Leninist doctrine that the party played in the domestic and foreign interaction of the USSR, the CPRF too should aim to become the country's new vanguard party. The first focus should be domestic stabilization, but ultimately, the CPRF's influence should also be carried abroad, for the good of Russia and the good of the world."
 SOV_take_control_of_the_oligarchy: "Take Control of the Oligarchy"
 SOV_take_control_of_the_oligarchy_desc: "The oligarchy is a dangerous clique of capitalist autocrats that operate Russia's economy from an ivory tower of unaccountable influence and sheer endless wealth. The vision of the communist planned economy and the transition to stateless communism does however require strong economic control and large-scale economic interventionism. By just replacing the oligarchs with our party officials, we will be able to take over the economy seemlessly."
 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils: "Civilian Industrial Councils"
 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils_desc: "In our efforts to rekindle Russian industrialism, we must create jobs that focus on carrying the Russian economy through the construction of a large amount of heavy machinery. While these jobs are not necessarily created to export any goods, we can also do so if we choose to support revolutionary movements with Russian-created machinery."
 SOV_military_industrial_councils: "Military Industrial Councils"
 SOV_military_industrial_councils_desc: "Expanding upon our calculations that we could use Civilian Industrial Councils, we could also invest in a collective-owned (that is to say, party-controlled) defense industry. With such a tool in our hands, we can create weapons that will not only allow us to guard Red Russia but also to support revolutionary movements around the world that aim to establish their own local version of communism."
 SOV_the_sfsr: "The SFSR"
 SOV_the_sfsr_desc: "We should not make the same mistake that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union's communism. The equality of nations under the USSR was a critical mistake, and we must instead engage in a nationally founded communism that is exclusively focussed on the needs, desires and sentiments of the Russians as a people and Russia as a nation. As a result, our communist state will be stronger and less likely to collapse to minorities."
 SOV_the_ussr: "The USSR"
 SOV_the_ussr_desc: "While we must be mindful of the nationalist separatism that led to the collapse of the first USSR, the creation of a second USSR is vital to the continuation of the Soviet revolution. Only by creating a strong communist system that can act as a superstructure over the varios nationalities of the world can we hope to overcome chauvinism, nationalism and arbitrary lines of division between humans."
 SOV_scientific_councils: "Scientific Councils"
 SOV_scientific_councils_desc: "We must endeavor to accelerate the careers of the brightest minds among young Russians through the country's best schools and universities to ultimately serve the revolution and the motherland at the scientific frontlines. Discovering new inventions, testing new hypotheses and developing new weapon systems, these prodigies will allow us to fortify and spread our glorious revolution."
 SOV_the_red_army: "The Red Army"
 SOV_the_red_army_desc: "The re-establishment of a communist-controlled army is absolutely necessary to overcome the threat of reactionary counterrevolution from within the armed forces. By binding the Red Army to the revolution's cause, just like it has been in 1917 and in 1941, we will create a military that serves not the interest of reactionary conservatives but that instead spearheads the communist revolution and that protects the working class."
 SOV_defensive_precautions_west: "Defensive Precautions West"
 SOV_defensive_precautions_west_desc: "Our strongest potential enemies lay west of Russia's borders, in Europe. Supported by north American interventionists, the western 'democracies' will aim to ultimately serve their capitalist agenda by bringing about the downfall of the Russian communist system. We must prepare for a defensive struggle for life and death in conventional warfare. And, if necessary, we will nuke our way to revolution too."
 SOV_communist_ambitions: "Communist Ambitions"
 SOV_communist_ambitions_desc: "We must aid our state's and our ideology's ultimate goals by fully subjugating all elements of state, economy, military and politics to serve the overarching goals of communist ideology as laid out in the old great works of the 1840s and the Russian expansion on communist doctrine between the 1910s and the 1930s."
 SOV_defensive_precautions_south: "Defensive Precautions South"
 SOV_defensive_precautions_south_desc: "While our most dangerous enemies are west of us, war with them is not too likely. But to the south, Russia is faced with far more dangerous elements. Georgia aims to oppress ethnic Russians in its north, the Central Asian republics look towards both Beijing and Washington for guidance, and the Middle East is still dominated by reactionary islamist circles that aim to destroy all that communists hold dear."
 SOV_territorial_demands: "Territorial Demands"
 SOV_territorial_demands_desc: "The restoration of Soviet glory must ultimately come through the dissolution of those nation states that were created by capitalists to safeguard their capital from the communist revolution. Which is essentially all nation states, really."
 SOV_baltic_republics: "The Baltic Republics"
 SOV_baltic_republics_desc: "The re-establishment of Soviet Republics in the Baltic might seem dangerous because of Estonia's, Latvia's and Lithuania's ties with the west, but communism must not be hindered by the diplomatic maneuvers by capitalist policy makers. Ultimately, they are all cowards, and we will overcome their bullying on our way to restore and rebuild our beloved Soviet Union."
 SOV_caucasian_republics: "Caucasian Republics"
 SOV_caucasian_republics_desc: "Striking south into the Caucasus will allow us to swiftly and decisively beat back western meddling in Russia's underbelly, and put the Soviet Union back on Turkey's border. There is not better way to keep NATO in check than by threatening them at all fronts at the same time."
 SOV_southern_republics: "Southern Republics"
 SOV_southern_republics_desc: "The republics of Asia were never particularly central - except geographically - to Soviet life, but they were a vital and valued part of the communist experience nonetheless. It was here that the USSR conquered space. It was here that the USSR mastered the atom. The USSR was here to stay, and its removal was illegitimate. It shall be restored."
 SOV_communist_europe: "Communism in Europe"
 SOV_communist_europe_desc: "While Europeans generally give communism rather poor ratings, this is mostly based on the scaremongering of the capitalist class. The track record must be set straight. We just have to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."
 #Yavlinsky
 SOV_deals_with_europe: "Deals with Europe"
 SOV_deals_with_europe_desc: "Whereas Zhirinovsky speaks of neo-imperial Russian glory and Zyuganov favors the creation of neo-Soviet systems of government (with implicit annexations to boot), Yavlinsky cares mainly about the economic prosperity of the Russian Federation and the individual fortunes of each Russian. We must befriend Europe, not attack her."
 SOV_national_economic_goals: "National Economic Goals"
 SOV_national_economic_goals_desc: "The Russian economic stagnation of the 1990s set the country back decades in development and left her a second-rate power behind the western democracies. We must establish firm and concise economic goals for the country to have precise roadmaps when and where to grow public and private economic sectors to maximize economic growth."
 SOV_baltic_economic_cooperation: "Baltic Economic Cooperation"
 SOV_baltic_economic_cooperation_desc: "The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania still view Russia as a great threat. They remember Russian imperialism of the 18th and 19th Centuries and the Soviet annexation of 1940. The new Russia has left those interventionist roads of bloodshed behind. We will be the friends of the Balts, to both our mutual profit. This is the best way to keep ethnic Russians in the Baltic safe."
 SOV_european_university_connections: "European University Connections"
 SOV_european_university_connections_desc: "Yavlinsky has made it a core goal of his policy to improve the quality of higher education in Russia. The best universities in the world are to be found in the western democracies, and Russia must endeavor to connect its own university system with that of its western partners to allow Russia's students to remain internationally competitive with their western peers."
 SOV_russian_defensive_preparations: "Russian Defensive Preparations"
 SOV_russian_defensive_preparations_desc: "While the military is not Yavlinsky's primary focus, it remains a vital pillar of Russia's national structure and a great source of the patriotic pride of Russians. It is also important to keep Russia safe from domestic terrorism, and it has been suspected that Yavlinsky's pro-western stance might make enemies of Beijing. Regardless of who they fight, the Russian forces must be ready to meet the challenge."
 SOV_kaliningrad_development: "Kaliningrad Revitalization"
 SOV_kaliningrad_development_desc: "Cut off from mainland Russia by the Baltic States, the Kaliningrad Oblast is an often forgotten part of the Federation. It is however indeed vitally important as a seaport in the Baltic Sea, especially during winter, and it provides a sneaky internal border for 'domestic flights' that can thus bypass the Baltic States to directly deliver goods to Poland and beyond. And economic revitalization is important."
 SOV_fight_the_elites: "Fight the Elites"
 SOV_fight_the_elites_desc: "The Russian people have been unfairly described as a people that is naturally drawn to authoritarian forms of government. This western caricature was a result of the Tsarist totalitarianism being immediately followed by a totalitarian communist coup against a weak democracy. We must not repeat the mistakes of the elitist Kerensky state. We are the state of the Russians, not another autocracy."
 SOV_democratic_idealism: "Democratic Idealism"
 SOV_democratic_idealism_desc: "Although the past political systems don't show great track records for Russian democracy, the Russians are an enlightened people that desire political participation and individual freedoms and self-expression. We must stand under the overarching ideal of democracy and liberty."
 SOV_kaliningrad_military_sector: "Kaliningrad Arms Sector"
 SOV_kaliningrad_military_sector_desc: "Kaliningrad is a fantastic spot to create a powerful subsector of the Russian defense industry, as it is in a prime spot to export military goods into the European economic area as well as into the maritime trade network via its access to the Baltic Sea."
 SOV_expand_the_university_of_moscow: "Invest in the Universities"
 SOV_expand_the_university_of_moscow_desc: "Russia is home to some of the world's brightest individuals, like Grigori Perelman, Garry Kasparov and Zhores Alferov. However, even though Russia has such vast intellectual potential, it remains largely untapped in the nation's education system, as the country's most accomplished individuals are often drawn abroad. We must improve our own system to entice them to stay."
 SOV_soviet_trials: "Trials of the Soviets"
 SOV_soviet_trials_desc: "To bring accountability to the Russian people, our new liberalized state needs to make sure that past crimes against the commoners, committed by bureaucrats and party cadres of the Soviet Union, do not go unpunished. We must shine a light on the Soviet surveillance state, on the USSR's political oppression and on the self-enrichment schemes that were in place during the time of the Soviet Union."
 SOV_reformed_russian_armed_forces: "Reorganized Russian Armed Forces"
 SOV_reformed_russian_armed_forces_decs: "Although the new Russia rejects aggressive military force as a means to an end, it is still a large country with a long list of potential enemies, both internal and external. While we might have qualms about conscription and other forms of forced service, that does not mean that we should just leave our military forces by the wayside. The armed forces must continue development."
 SOV_russia_studies_abroad: "Russia Studies Abroad"
 SOV_russia_studies_abroad_desc: "As part of the new state's education outreach, it is necessary to win favorable opinions of both our nation and its education system by offering courses, both Russian and otherwise, about Russia and the Russian language in foreign countries. By endorsing Russia-focussed educational pursuits in foreign lands, we can with both the hearts and minds of a new generation of foreigners."
 SOV_infrastructure_program: "Pan-Eurasian Infrastructure Projects"
 SOV_infrastructure_program_desc: "To increase our economic mobility and strength, we need to connect Russia to the European and Asian infrastructure network, including the highway and railroad systems."
 SOV_fight_communism: "Fight Communism"
 SOV_fight_communism_desc: "As part of our anti-Soviet sentiment, we also need to lead young people away from the dangerous influence of communism. We need to include historical and economic lessons in the education system that stress the risk of communist totalitarianism and the volatility of planned economies."
 SOV_fight_nationalism: "Root Out Nationalists"
 SOV_fight_nationalism_desc: "Next to our efforts to discourage young Russians from becoming communists, we also have to prevent them from becoming right-wing weirdos as well. Blaming historical episodes like the world wars on nationalism and stressing the economic dangers of protectionist isolationism should discourage many attentive students from falling to these dangerous ideas."
 SOV_approach_nato: "Approach NATO"
 SOV_approach_nato_desc: "While there is no doubt that historically NATO was created specifically against Moscow, the state that ruled Moscow in 1949 is gone. With the Soviet Union's downfall, a virile and strong democratic Russia has risen, and virile strong democracies is exactly what NATO needs."
 SOV_maintain_csto: "Maintain the CSTO"
 SOV_maintain_csto_desc: "While we do not seek conflict with NATO, it is clear that membership in that organization would come with its own bureaucratic and tactical nightmares. Many NATO states don't trust Russia, and it is not advisable for our security to allow them access to too much information about our military. We shall stick with our own CSTO, established in the late 1990s."
 SOV_bastion_of_democracy: "Bastion of Democracy"
 SOV_bastion_of_democracy_desc: "With the liberties of the citizens of Russia secured and extremism fought off, it is safe to say that our country has truly become a bastion of democracy. Now we know how the Americans feel: we can tell people that we love freedom and that they hate freedom, and if they object, we can just call them haters and bomb them."
 SOV_bring_democracy_to_central_asia: "Bring Democracy to Central Asia"
 SOV_bring_democracy_to_central_asia_desc: "As part of our efforts to 'secure' the political freedoms of the people of the former Soviet Union, we should strongly consider dealing with the autocrats of Central Asia. We just need to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."
 SOV_liberalize_russian_society: "Liberalize Russian Society"
 SOV_liberalize_russian_society_desc: "It has been asserted that the Russians as a people are unfit for democracy and predetermined to live under authoritarian rule. The tsars, the Soviets and Yeltsin all weren't the greatest torch bearers of freedom and democracy - but our new state is. Our new society is more liberal and freedom-loving than any that came before it."
 SOV_russian_values: "Russian Values"
 SOV_russian_values_desc: "Instead of giving into willy-nilly darn libruls, we need to maintain what has made our country strong. The Russians' dedication to their homeland, self-subjugation to their faith, and diligence in delivering their labor to the benefit of all of society. That is what made us great, and it will keep making us great. Make Russia Great! Again?"
 SOV_reform_the_oblasts: "Reorganize the Oblasts"
 SOV_reform_the_oblasts_desc: "The oblasts' autonomies must be redefined and their authorities rewritten to keep our new government's agenda on track."
 SOV_encourage_free_thought: "Encourage Free Thought"
 SOV_encourage_free_thought_desc: "In a free society live free people. By allowing and encouraging them to organize into societies and political organizations, we will create a more passionate society that produces more scientific and intellectual results as well as more art, industrial labor and agricultural produce."
 SOV_army_of_the_republic: "Army of the Republic"
 SOV_army_of_the_republic_desc: "Central to our state's survival, the Russian Armed Forces must not be forgotten during our reorganization process of the Russian Federation. As a central bearer of Russian cultural norms and values, the Army of the Republic shall fight on every front where our freedoms are threatened."
 SOV_reform_the_army: "Reform the Army"
 SOV_reform_the_army_desc: "It has been part of our political platform to weed out corruption in the armed forces for a long time. Incompetent generals must be removed and replaced with more competent counterparts."
 SOV_encourage_free_expression: "Encourage Free Expression"
 SOV_encourage_free_expression_desc: "We must further our citizens' aspirations to be free-thinking individuals that aim to leave a mark on the world. Russia has always been a nation of great artists and political thinkers, and our new state has created an environment more suited than ever to such a people."
 SOV_embrace_the_orthodox_church: "Embrace the Orthodox Church"
 SOV_embrace_the_orthodox_church_desc: "The Orthodox Church is the most important ally any Russian political leader could ask for. By giving the clerics increased political and social influence, we will gain their favor in return, securing the hearts and minds of the faithful for a thousand generations."
 SOV_more_universities: "Intensify Education Investments"
 SOV_more_universities_desc: "At the beginning of every free thinker stands a wise and benevolent mentor that teaches the free thinker to think freely. In the case of our state, this mentor is the Russian education system - which could be a problem, considering the Russian education system is chronically underfunded. More money needs to be diverted towards the education system."
 SOV_full_secularism: "State Sponsored Secularism"
 SOV_full_secularism_desc: "When discussing religious values, we need to make sure to distance ourselves from all religious institutions, especially the Orthodox Church. Its dangerous and subversive influence is essentially the last remainder of the tsarist system. It's also full of pedophiles. No, thanks."
 SOV_religious_republicanism: "Religious Republicanism"
 SOV_religious_republicanism_desc: "Our republic needs religion, and our religion needs to be a republic. Only if a state protects its religion, and only if a religious institution protects its state, can both prosper."
 #Primary Military Branch
 SOV_military_reform: "Military Reforms"
 SOV_military_reform_desc: "The dissolution of the Soviet Union left the Armed Forces of its member states outdated and underfunded. Where the United States and its NATO allies kept investing in their militaries, the soldiers of the post-Soviet republics received essentially no new equipment or doctrines. We have a lot of ground to cover and a lot of headstart to make up for."
 SOV_army_reform: "Sukhoputnye"
 SOV_army_reform_desc: "The Sukhoputnye, 'Ground Forces', are the land-based branch of the Russian army, and the one that probably needs the most attention in order to account for Russia's geographic predisposition being both very big and very attackable. The Ground Forces, abandoned since the early 1990s, need new... everything. Artillery, tanks, rifles, everything. Let's get to work."
 SOV_armored_reform: "Mobile Forces"
 SOV_armored_reform_desc: "In order to secure the swift victories that Russians are so used to from the days of the war in Afghanistan, we need to keep the ground forces mobile and ready to deploy, with new tanks and motorized vehicles that can operate effectively and reliably under enemy fire."
 SOV_infantry_modernization: "Infantry Modernization"
 SOV_infantry_modernization_desc: "The backbone of the army is the soldier on the ground, the infantryman. While new tanks, new trucks, new planes and new ships are nice and all, the core of the army is essentially a guy with a good rifle and a good helmet and good training. But sadly, our troops currently have none of that."
 SOV_rifle_renovations: "Rifle Renovations"
 SOV_rifle_renovations_desc: "We need to give out new infantry weapons to our soldiers to keep up with the progress of weapons in other countries, like the U.S. M4A1 or the German HK416."
 SOV_special_forces: "Special Forces"
 SOV_special_forces_desc: "The special forces were a great point of pride during the Soviet times, when the USSR was the first nation to introduce paratroopers in the early 1930s. Later, the USSR special forces fought successfully in Afghanistan and Russian special forces in Chechnya and Dagestan."
 SOV_t14_armata: "T-14 Armata"
 SOV_t14_armata_desc: "First revealed in a parade in 2015, the T-14 Armata is a 48-ton modern titan of the battlefield, Armed with a 2A82-1M 125mm main cannon, the T-14 will surely outmatch every standard issue main battle tank in the world."
 SOV_expand_the_speznaz: "Expansion of the Spetsnaz"
 SOV_expand_the_speznaz_desc: "The Voyska spetsialnovo naznacheniya, or Spetsnaz for short, are the Special Purpose Military Units of the Russian Federation. They are the first to engage the enemy, and at the end of a bloody battle, they are the last left standing."
 SOV_amphibious_infantry: "Amphibious Infantry"
 SOV_amphibious_infantry_desc: "To prevent getting bogged down in one of Eastern Europe's eternal land wars, we need elite amphibious landing forces to storm the enemy's shoreline. Inspired by the United States Marine Corps, our new Amphibious Infantry forces will combine the strength of the Russian Ground Forces and the Russian Navy."
 SOV_naval_reform: "Naval Reform"
 SOV_naval_reform_desc: "Looking back to a proud history that started in the 1690s, the Russian Navy represents our great nation's naval and ocean-bound forces. Russia, ever dependent on its access to the various seas it borders, will need naval forces to protect those seas from enemy influence and intervention."
 SOV_destroyer_reform: "Destroyer Reforms"
 SOV_destroyer_reform_desc: "Destroyers form the backbone of the Russian surface navy, but their number has dwindled in recent years as more have been scrapped than have been built. We should replenish the number of destroyers with a wave of new models."
 SOV_carrier_modernization: "Carrier Modernization"
 SOV_carrier_modernization_desc: "The Soviet Navy never greatly valued the aircraft carriers like their American counterparts did. Now, the Admiral Kuznetsov is outdated and old, whereas the U.S. Navy features two dozen modern aircraft carriers. If we are to compete with these imminent air strikes, we need new and better carriers to keep pace."
 SOV_lada_class_submarines: "Lada Class Submarines"
 SOV_lada_class_submarines_desc: "In development since 1997, the Lada class is a new generation diesel submarine designed to succeed the Project 363 and provide a better and more reliable long-range submarine to interdict enemy warships and disrupt enemy trade vessels."
 SOV_air_force_reform: "Air Force Reform"
 SOV_air_force_reform_desc: "The Russian air force, desperately out of shape since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is in dire need of a technical overhaul and a numerical renewal. We need to introduce new types of aircraft and helicopters, and we need to hire more talented young air force officers, just like those who won the Great Patriotic War against Hitler."
 SOV_ka_226: "KA-226"

 #Economic Programs
 SOV_economic_programs: "Economic Programs"
 SOV_economic_programs_desc: "Our economic programs are out of whack with the current reality of the world's financial situation. Russia needs to simultaneously juggle internal domestic peace through low prices and high wages, while also appeasing international oil and gas customers and maintaing the inflow of vital economic imports to Russia."
 SOV_rebuild_grozny: "Rebuild Grozny"
 SOV_rebuild_grozny_desc: "After the horrors of the Chechen War, the Grozny area and surrounding Chechnya have to rebuilt to give the people there a renewed economic perspective and, hopefully, to sway the region's young men away from joining a new generations of terrorist militias hostile to the Russian Federation."

 SOV_please_the_moscow_oligarchs_desc: "While dealings with the oligarch class might be uncomfortable for both the people and the government, they have established powerful and effective connections in the past decade. To use these connections is wise to expand any given urban area's economy, particularly Moscow."
 SOV_diversify_the_economy: "Diversify the Economy"
 SOV_diversify_the_economy_desc: "Russia is a resource producing nation based around the export of natural resources as one of its main economic sources of income. This has several problems: for one, our resources are over time going to grow more expensive to produce and ship abroad, and on the other hand, we are dependent on other nations' funds for our survival. We must diversify our economy quickly."

 SOV_economic_stimulus: "Economic Stimulus"
 SOV_economic_stimulus_desc: "To infuse an economy, sometimes a stimulus is necessary. The government must lend money to business owners with the understanding that the business owners build their businesses with the money given to them."
 SOV_russian_federation_stabilization_fund: "Russian Federation Stabilization Fund"
 SOV_russian_federation_stabilization_fund_desc: "Established in 2004, the Стабилизационный фонд Российской Федерации ('Stabilization fund of the Russian Federation') was an initiative by the Putin government to safeguard the country's vulnerable petroleum industry from potential drops in the oil price. The fund was a result of the lessons learnt after the 1998 economic crisis, which had been partially caused by volatile gas and oil prices."
 SOV_expansionary_monetary_policy: "Expansionary Monetary Policy"
 SOV_expansionary_monetary_policy_desc: "Our monetary policy must shift gears towards expansionary measures. Our central bank must be instructed to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates, increasing the money supply and thus increasing the aggregate demands of the Russian consumer base."

 SOV_overcome_the_1998_crisis_desc: "The 1998 Russian financial crisis, colloquially known as the 'Russian Flu', had started on 17 August 1998 and ultimately resulted in Russia's Central Bank defaulting on its debt, causing deep economic distrust by international observers in Russia's internal financial stability. The road of recovery will be hard, but it is necessary."
 SOV_heavy_industry_investments: "Heavy Industry Investments"
 SOV_heavy_industry_investments_desc: "To move away from Russia's dominant model of resource production and export, Russia must move back from a service economy in the cities to dominantly feature heavy industrial plants."
 SOV_attract_international_investors: "Attract Foreign Investors"
 SOV_attract_international_investors_desc: "Russia, although massive, is not in an economic state that befits its impressive size. With Russia's economic elite in a less than ideal state, Russia's local businesses rely on international suppliers and customers to make ends meet. This is where a healthy influx of foreign investors could aid the economic situation of the country."
 SOV_international_oil_price_agreements: "International Oil Price Agreements"
 SOV_international_oil_price_agreements_desc: "As an oil exporter, Russia is a rival of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC, which unites 15 of the world's petroleum exporters in what essentially amounts to price fixing. However, that doesn't have to be bad: Russia could make underhanded deals with OPEC to also stimulate the oil price to rise."
 SOV_resist_international_sanctions: "Resist Sanctions"
 SOV_resist_international_sanctions_desc: "The threat of economic sanctions has been applied against Russia even during Soviet times, and the experiences have only made the Russian economy more prepared to exist in states of autarchy and self-reliance. The western economic meddling will be unable to break Russia's economic independence and its national spirit."

 SOV_rise_of_the_oligarchs: "Rise of the Oligarchs"
 SOV_rise_of_the_oligarchs_desc: "The strength of the oligarchic class directly translates to economic strength. The fearmongering of socialists and other scum about rich, successful and perfectly legitimate businesspeople just shows how lazy these hillbillies are.

 SOV_deregulation: "Deregulation"
 SOV_deregulation_desc: "Market regulation leads to corruption, miscalculation and economic chaos. We should encourage the growth of whatever industry proves profitable under a system of free trade, free currency and free barter. Only a free economy can hope to be a strong economy."
 SOV_regulate_the_market: "Regulate the Market"
 SOV_regulate_the_market_desc: "Whoever decided that 'free markets' are a good thing that do good things is an idiot. Our government needs to make it a central policy to regulate the market to produce results desired by the Russian people."
 SOV_nationalize_foreign_industry: "Nationalize Foreign Industries"
 SOV_nationalize_foreign_industry_desc: "Industrial plants owned by foreigners are always an economic security risk. With foreign countries threatening us with economic sanctions, it is always a threat that the industrial owners leave over night and take vital parts of their plants with them. To prevent that, we need to claim these industries for the state - even if it offends the foreign states."

 SOV_appease_foreign_powers: "Appease Foreign Powers"
 SOV_appease_foreign_powers_desc: "To secure Russia's domestic and foreign peace, the great powers abroad need to both stop looking at Russia as an imminent threat and to stop looking at Russia as a potential victim. If we can convince the foreigners that we are no longer a direct threat to them, their punitive force against us might decrease."
 SOV_nordstream: "Nord Stream"
 SOV_nordstream_desc: "Nord Stream is a gas pipeline project through the Baltic Sea to one of Russia's main gas recipients, Germany. Such a system allows Russia and Germany bypass the states of Eastern Europe for their gas transfers, thus giving Russia free hand to bully those countries, and Germany the freedom to ignore the bullying."

 SOV_trade_with_nko: "Trade with North Korea"
 SOV_trade_with_nko_desc: "The North Korean regime has had one of its few supporters and backers in the Soviet Union. Russia, more concerned with its internal struggles, has failed to properly succeed the USSR as a partner to North Korea's economic and political interests, and has thus allowed Pyongyang to slip into Beijing's sphere of influence. For the sake of our strategic position in the far east, we must re-engage relations."
 SOV_trade_with_sko: "Trade with South Korea"
 SOV_trade_with_sko_desc: "For the longest time, Moscow was a tentative supporter of the North Korean regime in Pyongyang. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea has firmly joined the rank's of China's geopolitical outreach. Pyongyang no longer depends on Russian assistance, and its rival government in Seoul has shown itself to be more economically talented. Russia should realign its interests to South Korea."
 SOV_trade_with_authoritarianism: "Trade with Authoritarian Countries"
 SOV_trade_with_authoritarianism_desc: "While democracies are free, authoritarianism makes for reliable dependencies. Typically, authoritarian government are worse at expanding their own economic outreach and diversity than democratic states and they are as a result more likely to fall into long-standing economic vassalages to their trade partners. Perhaps, that is a niche in which Russia would fit well."
 SOV_trade_with_democratic_countries: "Trade with Democratic Countries"
 SOV_trade_with_democratic_countries_desc: "The world's democracies usually have a higher degree of economic freedom, non-intervention of government in private business and financial stability than their autocratic counterparts. As a results, it might be desirable to build up significant trade relations with the world's democratic countries. Russia, ever in need of reliable partners to export its natural resources to, could use good standing with them."
 SOV_expansionary_trade_policy: "Expand Trade Policy"
 SOV_expansionary_trade_policy_desc: "In a modern, globalized world, it is essential to have a modern, globalized trade policy. Russia is rich in natural resources, but has to catch up to western states in terms of accessibility of high-paying jobs to stop highly qualified Russian workers from emigrating from the country. To do so, Russia paradoxically must not shut down but open up. More trade will result in larger profits and more jobs for Russians."

 russia.1.t: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometers north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 #Russian News Events
 russia_news.1.t: "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d: "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his skeptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1: "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d: "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1: "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t: "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1: "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t: "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d: "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1: "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2: "...who?"
 russia_news.5.t: "Rise of the Soviet Union"

The Russian Navy has publicly offered several explanations, including a collision or an attack by a NATO submarine. The NATO general secretary has already denied these allegations. The death toll stands at 118, which equals the entire crew of K-141."
 russia_news.50.o1: "A great tragedy!"
