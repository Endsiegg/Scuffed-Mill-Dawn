The equality of nations under the USSR was a critical mistake, and we must instead engage in a nationally founded communism that is exclusively focussed on the needs, desires and sentiments of the Russians as a people and Russia as a nation.

 russia.1.t: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometers north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 #Russian News Events
 russia_news.1.t: "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d: "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his skeptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1: "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d: "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1: "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t: "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1: "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t: "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d: "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1: "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2: "...who?"
 russia_news.5.t: "Rise of the Soviet Union"
 russia_news.5.d: "The Russian Government has recently elected communists. It has become clear now that they wish to seek the unification of the Soviet States once more."

 russia_news.5.o3: "Troubling News"
 russia_news.5.o4: "Terrible."
 russia_news.50.t: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia_news.50.d: "The officials of the Russian Federation have recently reported that the Russian Navy submarine K-141, designated name 'Kursk', has sunk in the Barents Sea, 75 kilometers from the shoreline of the Kola peninsula, on August 12th, 2000, at roughly 11:30 AM. The Russian Navy has publicly offered several explanations, including a collision or an attack by a NATO submarine. The NATO general secretary has already denied these allegations. The death toll stands at 118, which equals the entire crew of K-141."
 russia_news.50.o1: "A great tragedy!"
 russia_news.50.o2: "Send our condolences to our allies."
 russia_news.50.o3: "We hope the Russians will be fine."
 russia_news.50.o4: "They got what was coming to them."
 russia_news.7.t: "Russia Joins The WTO!"
 russia_news.7.d: "After a long negotiating process with the existing members of the World Trade Organization, Russia has finally achieved a ratification of its application to join the WTO. Russia has had to demonstrate to the members of the WTO, especially the United States and the European Union, that it is making notable steps towards fixing its economy to competition. Russian state media hailed this event as \"a historic moment in Russian reforms and an economic recovery after the economic collapse after the USSR dissolution\"."
 russia_news.7.o1: "We're opening our doors!"
 russia_news.7.o2: "Russia opens up to the world."
 russia_news.7.o3: "Russia opens up to the world."
 russia_news.7.o4: "Curse them."
 russia_news.8.t: "Russia Renames Militsiya to Police"
 russia_news.8.d: "The law On Police was signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev quite recently as part of a full-fledged reform of law enforcement structures. The law On Police, developed as part of the reform of the Russian internal affairs bodies, provides that the militia will change its name to the police. The law defines the status, rights and duties of a police officer; frees the police from duplicating and unusual functions, strengthens the partnership model of relations between the police and society."
 russia_news.8.o1: "How interesting."
 russia_news.8.o2: "Based."

 sov_yeltsin.1.t: "Yeltsin's Legacy"
 sov_yeltsin.1.d: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the drunkard Yeltsin turned out to be the president of Russia, who could not effectively lead the country. The collapse of the USSR, the dissolution of the Supreme Council, the Chechen campaigns, loans-for-shares auctions, the denomination and default of 1998 - all this fell on the shoulders of the Russian people and crushed the hopes for a brighter future. Russia has recently chosen a president with whom it will enter the third millennium. After the difficult 1990s, there was a demand in the country for a solid and effective leader. There were hopes that after the reforms, an improvement in life would finally come. That elementary order will be put in place. And it was on Putin, who rapidly gained popularity as prime minister and acting. President, these hopes were pinned. In the 90s, after the shooting of the White House, as well as numerous disagreements in Russian society, a politician came to power who was able to consolidate all the warring parties and began to create a new political system ... What will come of it?"
 sov_yeltsin.1.a: "Let's see how he does."

At all subsequent protest actions, the number of people will be deliberately underestimated by the Central Internal Affairs Directorate. Rallies For Fair Elections were held in 99 cities of Russia and 45 more cities abroad. The Moscow Department of Education unexpectedly appointed a control for all high school students, which caused another wave of indignation. People came to Bolotnaya with a huge number of home-made posters and demanded new and fair elections."

The press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow on Sunday said that as a result of the actions of the protesters in the center of Moscow, four police officers were injured, who received bruises and cut wounds. At the same time, it became known about the demonstrators' attempt to break through the dense police cordon. According to Vedomosti correspondents, it was then that a Molotov cocktail flew to the police. In response, the police began to detain oppositionists breaking through the cordon and put them on buses. According to the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, despite the fact that the protesters threw dangerous objects at the police, the gas was not used against them. A law enforcement source told Vedomosti that Article 212 on inciting to riots is being tried on the organizers of the event, including Sergei Udaltsov and Alexei Navalny. So far, they are not suspects yet. According to the interlocutor of Vedomosti, "under Article 318 on violence against police officers, people who threw bottles at police officers and got into fights with them will be involved."

Although at that time the Donetsk Euromaidan activist Dmitry Chernyavsky had already been killed, and the so-called Donetsk Peoples Republic had been proclaimed, the separatists had no real power. The personnel of the police and the SBU waited, there was no mass support of the locals. Quite a lot of people were really going to watch regular rallies, but there were very few people in the seized premises of the regional administration in Donetsk: they were city madmen, criminal and semi-criminal persons, pro-Russian activists, visiting Russian outcasts from the border regions. Of the entire cohort of leaders of the then DPR, only Alexander Khryakov and Andrey Purgin from the public organization Donetsk Republic, founded back in the mid-2000s, were relatively well-known. Almost everyone in Donetsk was firmly convinced that the home-grown separatists would rally for several days and disperse. However, the situation escalated sharply. Moreover, where they were not expected - in Slavyansk (population - 120 thousand at that time) in the north of the region, a detachment of armed people of 52 people entered. First of all, they seized the city police department almost without resistance. The attackers threw explosive packages at the building, then with the help of a car they tore off the bars from the windows and went inside."
