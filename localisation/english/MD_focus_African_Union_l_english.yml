 AFRICAN_UNION_shared_focus_common_currency_dinar_desc: "Libyan Dinar has been in use since 1971. Never that strong against the dollar, the Dinar has mainly been Gaddafi's show of resistance against US dollar driver economies.

The treaty would prohibit research, development, manufacture, stockpiling, acquisition, testing, possession, control or stationing of nuclear weapons in African countries, and enforces high standards for any peaceful nuclear research and production.

 AFRICAN_UNION_shared_focus_speak_french_desc: "Currently, business and politics in the African Union is handled in many official languages;  Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and 'any other African language'. While such diversity is nice, we should pick one as the main language. French is an official language in many West African countries, though there are not that many native speakers. Roughly a third of the people in West Africa can speak the language however. It makes the most sense to use French as the working language of the Union."

 AFRICAN_UNION_shared_focus_speak_english_desc: "Currently, business and politics in the African Union is handled in many official languages;  Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and 'any other African language'. While such diversity is nice, we should pick one as the main language. English is very popular in Africa due to its colonial past and the lingua franca status of English.

While such diversity is nice, we should pick one as the main language. Arabic is the most spoken language in Africa, although it has many regional variations.
