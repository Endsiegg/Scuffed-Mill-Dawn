 germany: "Germany Focus Tree"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry: "CDU Ties to the Automotive Industry"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry_desc: "While the Christian conservative CDU/CSU is not as deeply connected to the automotive industry as Gerhard Schröder is with Volkswagen, several important German car manufacturers are still located in predominantly conservative states in the south, notably Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg and BMW in Munich, Bavaria."
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe: "Automotive Investments in Europe"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc: "By aggressively pushing into other European markets, German car manufacturers could drastically reduce their personnel costs by leaving German industry and thus German wages behind in favor of European Union member states with lower standards of living. Mercedes-Benz seeks additional investments in Kecskemét, Hungary, whereas Volkswagen desires support for expansion in Bratislava, Slovakia."
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen: "Strengthen Volkswagen"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc: "The German Ministry of Finance found that 30% of jobs in Lower Saxony are either directly provided by or indirectly dependent on Volkswagen, the largest company in Germany and Germany's main corporate applicant of soft power abroad. Several percentage points of the German economy are solely provided by this one company - it is too big to fail."
 GER_the_kaluga_plant: "The Kaluga Plant"
 GER_the_kaluga_plant_desc: "Some 150 kilometers southeast of Russia's capital Moscow and located on the regional Oka River, Kaluga in the Kaluga Oblast has been identified by the Volkswagen group as a potential good fit to build VW or Audi models. This Kaluga plant could employ over 5,000 Russians at wages far lower than the automotive giants would have to pay to Germans."
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant: "The Aurangabad Plant"
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant_desc: "India is a large untapped market for the Volkswagen group. Whereas German cars are smash hits in China already, more time and marketing is needed to get the people of India, the second most populous country on earth, on board. If German companies don't act fast, Indian ones will soon pop up to fill the niche as more Indians move into economic brackets able to afford vehicles."
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china: "Expand Volkswagen into China"
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china_desc: "While the Chinese already buy Volkswagen cars, more can be done to get the company to employ Chinese laborers in the People's Republic itself. By making the government there dependent on Volkswagen's investments and labor provisions, the German market influence in China would increase drastically. The planned factories in Chengdu, Shanghai and Liaoning could easily employ tens of thousands."
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories: "Dresden and Leipzig Manufacturies"
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories_desc: "While it will be profitable to outsource Volkswagen jobs, it'll not make the homegrown population of automotive laborers particularly happy. In the traditional heavy labor hub that is the state of Saxony, Volkswagen plans new high skill factories - they will need a few government subsidies and tax cuts to make the project profitable, however."
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness: "Seize Opposition Weakness"
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness_desc: "With the Möllermann crisis in the FDP and the corruption scandal in the CDU/CSU, the opposition to Gerhard Schröder's SPD (red) and Joschka Fischer's Greens, who together form the government as the 'red-green coalition', is weaker than ever. This comes at an opportune moment, as the year 1999 had held several weak electoral results for the governing parties, even in traditionally left-leaning states."
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony: "Utilize SPD Influence in Lower Saxony"
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc: "Historically, the German Social Democrats, the SPD, played second fiddle to the much stronger CDU/CSU, the 'Union'. Only in 1998 did Gerhard Schröder dethrone four-term incumbent Helmut Kohl of the CDU. Schröder's power base lies in his home in Lower Saxony, one of the most loyal SPD voting states that is also home to Germany's largest company, Volkswagen, a political ally of Schröder."
 GER_infrastructural_reform: "Infrastructural Reform"
 GER_infrastructural_reform_desc: "Because of a brewing political crisis involving Minister of Infrastructure Reinhard Klimmt and his associated football club, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Klimmt should be replaced with a new Federal Minister for Traffic, Construction and Housing. Kurt Bodewig would be a worthwhile replacement."
 GER_coal_industry_compromise: "Coal Industry Compromise"
 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc: "While SPD and Greens were united in their opposition to the liberal decisionmaking of the Union and the FDP, the downfall of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999 and the rise of Schröder's Clintonite ideology presented a clear dissonance between Greens and SPD: Whereas Fischer seeks to eliminate fossil fuel usage, the SPD wants to preserve laborers in the industry. The main conflict has always been brown coal."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism: "Foreign Policy Pragmatism"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc: "The Schröder government has made several severe miscalculations during its first two years in office. The chancellor's push for a permanent German seat on the UN Security Council combined with a half-hearted attempt to pursue European Federalism, both of which alienated Germany's closest European partner, France. SPD and Greens need to realized the error of their ways."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung: "Limited Budget Consolidation"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc: "One of the Schröder administration's primary goals in office, the Haushaltskonsolidierung, 'budget consolidation', is not going to happen. The budget has kept bloating under social democratic leadership and private debt keeps growing on both a per capita and a per household basis. All Germany can do now is to introduce limited budget cuts in areas like defense spending to minimize the damage."
 GER_green_card_initiative: "Green Card Initiative"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc: "Inspired by American and Canadian immigration programs, the Schröder government has proposed the introduction of a 'Green-Card-Initiative' to quickly assemble foreign IT workers to accerelate the development of Germany's underdeveloped high-technology sector. The Kohl government before Schröder had neglected both internet and IT development, and this needs to be amended."
 GER_pension_reform: "Pension Reform"
 GER_pension_reform_desc: "One of the key talking points of the German social democrats against German conservatives has always been the size of pensions, and the electoral battle between Schröder and Kohl in 1998 was no different. Should the Schröder administration fail to at least provide token relief to Germany's elderly, the SPD's prestige among the working class would collapse utterly."
 GER_digitalized_education_system: "Digitalized Education System"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc: "One of Schröder's core promises during the 1998 campaign was 'Schulen ans Netz', 'schools onto the web', referring to the low rate of internet access and digitalization among German elementary and even high schools during the Kohl Administration. Seeing the 'Schulen ans Netz' program succeed would be costly, but hugely beneficial to Germany's pupils."
 GER_scientific_exchanges: "Scientific Exchanges"
 GER_scientific_exchanges_desc: "With foreign experts flocking to Germany to live and work in tech and start-up hubs like Cologne and Berlin, Germany's innovativeness has improved. To former formalize these exchanges, German research teams must regularly meet up with foreign colleagues to study and compare results."
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards: "Improved Federal Education Standards"
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards_desc: "In Germany, the concept of \"Bildungshoheit der Länder\", the 'state supremacy in education', takes away federal control of education policy and allows individual states to more autonomously set their own goals. The downside of this system is that some states' education like NRW and Bremen have fallen in prestige and standard behind that of states like Bavaria. This can be amended by federal minimums."
 GER_international_business: "International Business"
 GER_international_business_desc: "Germany often hails itself \"Exportweltmeister\", 'world champion of exports'. The German economy has traditionally seen significant trade surplusses, selling far more to other industrial nations than Germany itself purchases from them. A continuation of an export-friendly policy requires great amounts of foreign political pragmatism - the money of a dictator is just as good as the money of a popular leader, after all."
 GER_sino_german_deals: "Sino-German Deals"
 GER_sino_german_deals_desc: "Germany punches far above its weight when it comes to its export economy. The only country that comes anywhere close is the People's Republic of China, which sports more than 20 times the German population to power its insatiable economic engine. China is desperate for any way to power and more growth - the Chinese want German machines, German cars and the know-how of German companies."
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations: "Oil Trade Negotiations"
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations_desc: "The German petroleum supply is one of the country's most pressing emergencies. Germany's oil sources are diverse - Norway, Nigeria, Libya, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Scotland. Germany operates on all continents to gain and secure access to valuable resources."
 GER_nord_stream: "Nord Stream"
 GER_nord_stream_desc: "Schröder is notoriously friendly to Vladimir Putin, Russia's autocrat. The Russo-German trade relations revolve around Russian natural resources and their usage in Germany. Russian gas giant Gazprom has a plan to bypass Ukrainian and Polish oversight by getting Russian gas straight into Germany through a pipeline in the Baltic, \"Nord Stream\". This plan is great for German profits, but Eastern Europe won't like it."
 GER_appease_eastern_europe: "Appease Eastern Europe"
 GER_appease_eastern_europe_desc: "Our investments into Nord Stream pose a significant threat to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Ukrainian trade and transit profits regarding Russian oil delivered to Germany and the rest of western Europe. We have to trade the line carefully now, as to avoid completely alienating our reliable partners. Russia is not trustworthy enough to make that trade off worthwhile."
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers: "Accomodate Polish Migrant Workers"
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers_desc: "Polish labor migration into Germany goes back far in history - the 'Ruhr Poles' for example are a population of ethnic Poles in the Ruhr area that immigrated during the 19th Century to work as coal miners. Most recently, Germany and Poland signed a neighbor treaty in 1991. Hundreds of thousands of Poles enter Germany as seasonal workers every year, particularly in agriculture."
 GER_russo_german_partnership: "Russo-German Partnership"
 GER_russo_german_partnership_desc: "Polish defense minister Radoslaw Sikorski already likened our new business deals with the Russians to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is clear that our critics are incorrect about the Poles and their friends being more reliable than the Russians - they too are just out to backstab us at an opportune moment. Russia is a worthy partner that needs to be maintained."
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets: "Closer Integration with EAEU Markets"
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets_desc: "The Eastern European Union is Russia's (rather poor) imitation of the EU's economic compacts. Their problem is that they really don't have the economic power to back their economic ambitions - but German cooperation might help them with that."
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route: "Expand the Rhine Route"
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route_desc: "The Rhine is the most heavily used trade river in Europe and is the shared pride of the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland. Germany and the Netherlands depend on each other to maximize the trade potential."
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium: "Strengthen Ties to Belgium"
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium_desc: "After closing the ranks with our Dutch neighbors, we need to also aggressively push our companies into the Belgian market. German influence on Belgium and Belgian dependence upon Germany will be essential for any future conflict between the two nations regarding the outdated nuclear power plant at Tihange, one of the primary threats to German national security."
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade: "Trans-Atlantic Trade"
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade_desc: "By investing in the \"Deutsch-Amerikanische Handelskammern\" ('German American Chambers of Commerce'), the German economy could increase its bilateral ties to the markets in the United States, particularly by tailoring high-end German goods to the needs of American industry. That would serve both the German role as an export nation and the American role as an import nation."
 GER_trade_with_canada: "Trade with Canada"
 GER_trade_with_canada_desc: "Canada holds several key strengths as a trade partner: Abundance of natural resources, a highly educated workforce, strong pre-existing ties to Europe - and a huge dependency on a single country that they'd like to diversify away from. We have to find the hidden gears that could get a German-Canadian trade deal to function."
 GER_schroeder_ii: "Schröder II"
 GER_schroeder_ii_desc: "After assuming a first term as chancellor in 1998, Schröder has won several resounding political victories. The CDU and FDP crises regarding Kohl and Möllermann, respectively, have greatly diminished the conservatives' chances to win the election. Schröder's run for reelection could however still need some campaign boosts - like declining to join American wars of aggression."
 GER_auffangbank_concept: "'Auffangbank' Concept"
 GER_auffangbank_concept_desc: "Inspired by American Resolution Trust Corporations, or RTCs, the Schröder administration has brianstormed the creation of a German 'bad bank'-esque financial institute to predict and avoid future financial crises. But that would never happen, now would it?"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank: "Back Deutsche Bank"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank_desc: "Deutsche Bank (DB) is by far the largest bank in Germany, spanning almost 100,000 employees, over 2,500 outlets and scoring incomes of 1.6 billion Euros a year, more than triple that of their closest rivals, DZ Bank, KfW and Commerzbank, all of whom make about 500 million Euros. DB is central to the German banking system - although we should be careful to not have it involved in Russian corruption."
 GER_homegrown_software: "Homegrown Software"
 GER_homegrown_software_desc: "With the 'Schulen ans Netz' program in full effect, the funds should now also be diverted towards German multimedia companies like Nuremberg-based SoftMaker to develop utility and office programs to dissuade American-made software at the workplace. The German government could also subsidize the acquisition of licenses for such programs to double the incentive."
 GER_the_internet_neuland: "The Internet 'Neuland'"
 GER_the_internet_neuland_desc: "In an infamous speech on 19 June 2013, then Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that the internet 'is new territory for us all', although more than 95% of the German population by then had connection to the internet and more than half used it regularly. Merkel's comments were in a long line of conservative mishaps in internet policies - the slow speed of German internet connection goes back all the way to Kohl."
 GER_agenda_2010: "Agenda 2010"
 GER_agenda_2010_desc: "Gerhard Schröder was always a moderate among the social democrats and thus advocated restraint with the budget. The 'Agenda 2010' is an ambitious project of budget cuts and bureaucratic reforms that will without a doubt draw heavy criticism from leftist groups and push the government towards the center - but it could be fantastic for economic progress."
 GER_sports_funding: "Sports Funding"
 GER_sports_funding_desc: "In German politics, it usually proves very effective to generate domestic profit as well as political capital by funding and supporting sporting projects, particularly football stadiums."
 GER_hartz_iv: "Hartz IV"
 GER_hartz_iv_desc: "The 'Commission for Modern Services at the Labor Market', called the 'Hartz Commission' for its leader Peter Hartz, had to develop a new concept for the service market, categorized as Hartz I through Hartz IV. Hartz IV in particular, the new ruling on unemployment benefits, stands heavily against classical social democratic values and will garner heavy criticism from traditional SPD voters."
 GER_sonderparteitag: "Sonderparteitag"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc: "Since Lafontaine's withdrawal, Schröder's support among left-wing forces in Germany has been waning. Juggling the interests of employers and employees, of unions and corporations, of the economy and the working class has been controversial, to say the least. Gerhard Schröder, to save face, must now pass party leadership to fully focus on his office as Federal Chancellor."
 GER_vertrauensfrage: "Vertrauensfrage"
 GER_vertrauensfrage_desc: "Schröder has been unable to keep the Greens in line and his own SPD behind him. His primary way of enforcing his own policies has been to threaten his resignation and to thus threaten the remaining stability of the coalition. Now, with public support definitely gone, it is time to call a vote of confidence, a 'Vertrauensfrage'. Schröder fully intends to lose this vote and to call for immediate reelections."
 GER_schroeder_iii: "Schröder III"
 GER_schroeder_iii_desc: "The political power move has worked: Schröder secures his third term as Federal Chancellor and can now assemble a new coalition, either with the neoliberal FDP or the progressive Greens. Both the leftist PDS and the conservative CDU/CSU are unlikely to approve of this result and will continue hard-fought opposition to SPD policy."
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz: "Gewerkschaftsgesetz"
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz_desc: "The traditionally close relationship between the SPD and Germany's powerful labor unions will once more show itself with the passage of Schröder's Gewerkschaftsgesetz, a piece of legislation that will grant striking workers even greater autonomy and protection from the employer's attempts to cut strikes short. Critically, the law would pass almost all decisions as to strike ends to respective governments."
 GER_regions_of_innovation: "Regions of Innovation"
 GER_regions_of_innovation_desc: "Championed by the SPD electoral program of 2005, the Schröder government promised the reduction of bureaucracy and waiting periods as part of the 'Innovationsregionen' promise. These Regions of Innovation should greatly lessen the burden of daily life on the working class individual, even though a restriction of bureaucracy through spending cuts would likely bring conflict with the Greens."
 GER_trust_in_germany: "Trust in Germany"
 GER_trust_in_germany_desc: "The SPD aggressively led its reelection bid for Gerhard Schröder's third term as Federal Chancellor with the slogan \"Vertrauen in Deutschland\", 'Trust in Germany'. Playing to patriotic and communal feelings and connecting these energies with working class activism could be a real game winner for social democratic fervor - and for national unity against domestic and international obstacles."
 GER_further_union_reassurances: "Further Union Reassurances"
 GER_further_union_reassurances_desc: "After the successful passing of the Gewerkschaftsgesetz, the Schröder administration stands determined to forge a lasting and fruitful alliance with Germany's powerful labor unions, against international mega corporations and foreign investors."
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts: "Anti-Unemployment Efforts"
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts_desc: "Unemployment, \"Arbeitslosigkeit\" in German, is one of the primary antagonists that the social democrats of the SPD seek to fight against. Built on the 'Regions of Innovation' program, the SPD leadership has now put forward a wide range of 'employment guarantee' policies that could push down the unemployment by as much as half a percent of the German population."
 GER_pan_european_efforts: "Pan-European Efforts"
 GER_pan_european_efforts_desc: "Although Schröder's advances to establish a European Confederation under Franco-German leadership all but irritated Paris, with the reestablished and newly strengthened social democratic leadership, it must be seriously considered whether or not another advance on the European ideal would be out of the question."
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions: "Close Ranks with the International Unions"
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions_desc: "After reestablishing the labor unions as the dominant force in German public life, Germany needs to take a dominant stance in international labor organizations to enforce high-quality labor standards across Europe and then the world. As long as there are cheaper labor pools in the EU, the living standards of the German working class are threatened."
 GER_economic_prosperity: "Economic Prosperity"
 GER_economic_prosperity_desc: "Growth! Growth! Growth!\nThe economy must groooooooow!"
 GER_continental_education_investments: "Continental Education Investments"
 GER_continental_education_investments_desc: "Taking inspiration from the EuRopean community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS), the German government needs to take further steps to unite Europe's young people into a singular group of talent - a group that after their graduation would look at Germany for the highest possible wages for their careers."
 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy: "Return to Old Social Democracy"
 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy_desc: "If Willy Brandt was still alive, he'd rip Schröder's head off. The modern SPD has become too neoliberal, too friendly to megacorporations, and has drastically distanced itself from the working class. Some veterans of old school Social Democracy, like Helmut Schmidt and Oskar Lafontaine, are still around. Reintroducing themselves into politics might save the SPD after all."
 GER_brandtism: "Brandtism"
 GER_brandtism_desc: "Willy Brandt in the 1970s was a man of character: Worker-oriented, idealistic, anti-nationalistic, reformist, anti-communist. While a man like him will not be seen among German social democrats for another few centuries, returning to the roots of his philosophy is necessary to modernize a new and rejuvenated SPD."
 GER_european_leftism: "European Leftism"
 GER_european_leftism_desc: "Since the days Jean Jaures warned against a war between Europe's working peoples and died for it in 1914, the leftist movements across the continents have stood against nationalistic egomanias among the countries. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Jaures, Brandt, Schmidt, Walesa."
 GER_arbeiterstaat: "Arbeiterstaat"
 GER_arbeiterstaat_desc: "We have successfully created labor conditions that are worthy of our social democratic forefathers. Although economically still based in a capitalist market, our welfare state and employment efforts are now so complete that we can truly speak of a semi-socialist society, an 'Arbeiterstaat', workers' state."
 GER_heavy_industry_focus: "Heavy Industry Focus"
 GER_heavy_industry_focus_desc: "East Germany's downfall was partially caused by the socialists' early focus on heavy industry, whereas West Germany built a dynamic service industry. Now, building on that service industry, we can at last unleash Germany's ambitions to a strong and proud heavy industrial sector."
 GER_continue_the_third_way: "Continue the Third Way"
 GER_continue_the_third_way_desc: "The 'Third Way', championed by the likes of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, is a new style of social democracy. Liberal, pragmatic, business-oriented. Such a modernization was overdue and necessary to rescind the previous marxist leanings within European social democracy and bring it more in line with the American values of the Democratic Party as well as modern globalized neoliberals."
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe: "Appeasement in Eastern Europe"
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe_desc: "The Eastern Europeans, especially Poland and Ukraine, are REALLY annoyed with Nord Stream, as bypassing their pipelines gives the Russians leverage to blackmail Eastern European gas markets without threat of loss of Western European profits. We must make clear that, against this step backwards in our relations, we will stand firm with our commitments to our eastern partners."
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia: "Non-Aggression Principle with Russia"
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia_desc: "Between 1941 and 1945, Russia and Germany fought the most destructive conflict between any two nations in human history. Our two countries may never find themselves pitted against each other on the world's battlefields again."
 GER_break_with_putin: "Break with [SOV.GetLeader]"
 GER_break_with_putin_desc: "The Social Democrats have been uncomfortably close to Putin. The Russian President is not Germany's natural friend - and the SocDems must recognize this. Our political alliance with [SOV.GetLeader] must cease to exist."
 GER_seek_russias_favor: "Seek Russia's Favor"
 GER_seek_russias_favor_desc: "Russia, the home of the leftist revolution and anti-American power center for the better part of a hundred years, is our natural go-to partner to oppose yankee influence on the European continent."
 GER_international_non_alignment: "International Non-Alignment"
 GER_international_non_alignment_desc: "We must stay out of the world's conflict. If the Americans want to invade Iraq, they will have to do with us. That however does not mean we endorse Russian or Chinese authoritarians. Just stay out of our business, everybody. Germany will adopt a Swiss model of foreign policy."
 GER_angela_merkel: "Angela Merkel"
 GER_angela_merkel_desc: "With the lost Vertrauensfrage, Schröder's political capital and reputation with the German people was totally depleted. It was relatively easy for the conservative CDU/CSU, the 'Union', to pick up the pieces and sweep the election. Helmut Kohl's personal protegé, Angela Merkel, will be the main beneficiary. She will be the eighth Federal Chancellor of the FRG and the first woman to fill that post."
 GER_energy_reform: "Energy Reform"
 GER_energy_reform_desc: "The conservative Union opposed the Red-Green 'Atomkonsens' of 2000, in which the government decided to gradually shift away from nuclear energy in favor of renewables. The Merkel team views this step as rushed and vows to use nuclear energy for a longer period of time - and it would take a natural disaster close to a vulnerable nuclear power plant to make them flip flop on that promise..."
 GER_gesundheitspraemie: "Gesundheitsprämie"
 GER_gesundheitspraemie_desc: "A constantly popular talking point for conservative movements is the bloated nature of the budget. The Union, keenly aware of the German people's satisfaction with the healthcare program, attempted to reform its government budgeting by introducing a new kind of health tax, the 'Gesundheitsprämie'. It seeks to decrease the costs of employers and reshift them to the people in need of the service."
 GER_bmvi: "BMVI"
 GER_bmvi_desc: "Creating a Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure is part of the Merkel government's plan to drive forward digitalization efforts. This 'BMVI' will replace the BMVBS."
 GER_digitalrat: "Digitalrat"
 GER_digitalrat_desc: "Called upon by the Merkel IV cabinet, a digital council was established in 2018. Consisting of forward-thinking giants and innovative start up CEOs of multimedia and innovation, the chancellor's new digital advisor elite will provide her with more effective and profitable plans for Germany's digitalization efforts."
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises: "Seek Centrist Compromises"
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises_desc: "In order to secure power after Angela Merkel's election, the CDU should seek to establish a \"Grand Coalition\" between the Union and the SPD, the two largest parties. This would double up to assure limited conservative policy making and to isolate Gerhard Schröder. Schröder had humiliated himself after the election defeat and Angela Merkel would be able to assume the chancellorship with a clean sheet."
 GER_token_atomausstieg: "Token Atomausstieg"
 GER_token_atomausstieg_desc: "The 2005 Campaign had seen a pro-nuclear CDU/CSU pitted against the anti-nuclear SPD. The energy question will have to be solved to an unsatisfactory end for both sides in the coalition negotiations: The CDU/CSU will agree to an exit out of nuclear energy (German: \"Atomausstieg\") in the distant future, but the SPD will agree to not seek to accelerate the process beyond the Union's wishes."
 GER_strengthen_the_service_sector: "Strengthen the Service Sector"
 GER_strengthen_the_service_sector_desc: "West Germany completed its transformation into a service economy in the aftermath of the 1950s economic miracle and the downturn of the coal and heavy industry of the Ruhr. Since then, the country is a familiar face to young innovators, with Berlin standing as one of the world capitals of Start Up businesses."
 GER_industrial_outsourcing: "Industrial Outsourcing"
 GER_industrial_outsourcing_desc: "The German industrial sector has been massively weakened by the growth of wages and the free movement of labor to less fortunate European markets like Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The German government needs to make sure that the movement of industrial concerns is controlled by government subsidies and EU incentives in order to not lose jobs to more hostile rivals like China."
 GER_redistribute_cap_subsidies: "Redistribute CAP Subsidies"
 GER_redistribute_cap_subsidies_desc: "Launched in 1962, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) distributes farming subsidies to the union's various agricultural sectors. Germany, a service economy, has a workforce share of only about 2% in the primary sector. Currently, the CAP funds are too stacked towards the 'first pillar', the farmers that are already wealthy. Redistribution of these funds could provide relief to small farmers."
 GER_european_business_opportunities: "European Business Opportunities"
 GER_european_business_opportunities_desc: "With the removal of trade barriers across the continent, everyone's economic profit grows - but Germany's most of all, and that's good. We must work further to remove tariffs and trade restrictions, and make it easier to open businesses and make trade."
 GER_global_trade_initiatives: "Global Trade Initiatives"
 GER_global_trade_initiatives_desc: "Germany openly refers to itself as \"Exportweltmeister\", 'world champion of exports'. German goods are shipped into the entire world: Britain loves Germany's gummy bears, Chinese businessmen drive BMW and American companies use German machine parts. Our shippings will reach every port in the world."
 GER_animal_rights_reform: "Animal Rights Reform"
 GER_animal_rights_reform_desc: "The people at large are taking notice of brutalities against animals - more than 99% male chickens are slaughtered upon births, for example, as only female chickens are useful to lay eggs for agricultural production. Such atrocities are good for business, but are really unpopular with public. Some organizations like Greenpeace or PETA and populations like vegetarians and vegans are particularly annoyed."
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism: "Radicalize German Conservatism"
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism_desc: "Merkel should refuse any coalition and lead a minority government against leftist opposition. The Union could do so with limited initial aid from the FDP, even though further assistance from right wing members among the Greens and the SPD would be required to actually get policy made. A politically somewhat unsuccessful term, it might be ideologically useful to position the Union as conservative hardliners."
 GER_military_spending_offensive: "Military Spending Offensive"
 GER_military_spending_offensive_desc: "Schröder's SPD was always very happy to cut defense spending, reasoning that the Cold War was over and that the money was more needed in the social safety net and the welfare state. The CDU/CSU was left concerned about reaching the 2%-goal provided by NATO to its member states, demanding that 2% of GDP should be in defense spending. Germany needs to hurry to meet that demand."
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization: "Partial Autobahn Privatization"
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization_desc: "The privatization of the German highway system, the 'Autobahn', remains a hot-button issue in German politics. Leftist parties are generally supportive of big-government solutions and the total government control of the German road system, whereas the Free Democrats and Christian Democrats are more friendly to the idea of allowing private businesses into the equation."
 GER_german_nationalism: "German Nationalism"
 GER_german_nationalism_desc: "Since the defeats in the world wars, the German people have culturally been more reserved about patriotic outbursts and displays of nationalism than other comparable societies."
 GER_rehabilitate_prussia: "Rehabilitate Prussia"
 GER_rehabilitate_prussia_desc: "During German occupation, Law No. 46 by the Allied authorities saw to the dissolution of the Free State of Prussia on 25 February 1947. Prussia played a huge part in German history and its cultural association with German monarchism and militarism mark it as a nationalist relic of times gone by - a fervor that the government could play into by certain nostalgic acts rehabilitating the Prussian state."
 GER_imperial_ambition: "Imperial Ambition"
 GER_imperial_ambition_desc: "While often blamed for the initial rise of German proto-fascist sentiment and often associated with the blind nationalistic fervor of the early 1910s, the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 marked an era of stability and prosperity that the rest of Europe at that time failed to replicate."
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones: "Reestablish Local Thrones"
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones_desc: "While the German people at large remain skeptical of the return of the monarchy, some individual states are not as reserved: Returning the royal families of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hannover to their social positions, albeit as figureheads, should make the idea more likable to the more republican-minded parts of the German people. Let the boulevard press write about our own monarchs for once."
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration: "Hohenzollern Restoration"
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration_desc: "All preparations for constitutional changes are complete - the Federal Republic can be laid to rest, and a new constitutional monarchy can take its place. The Hohenzollern dynasty has made clear again and again that they do not seek power, but we should be able to convince them to ceremonially lead a loving people. In the background, we can then run the show with fewer obstacles."
 GER_national_ambition: "National Ambition"
 GER_national_ambition_desc: "Germany has one of the on a global cultural scale most infamous nationalisms of any country's history. The brutal atrocities committed under the influence of said nationalism has led to reservations against German nationalism both within the German cultural mindset and in the historic memory of any foreigner affected - countries like Poland or Russia would disapprove of nationalist resurgence."
 GER_voelkisch_fervor: "Völkisch Fervor"
 GER_voelkisch_fervor_desc: "To reestablish a feeling of national superiority is to reaffirm a culture of bigotry and resentful stereotypes that built up and survived in a German culture in spite of its heavy cultural aversions to any form of nationalism and bigotry. The Italians are sleazy, the Polish are thieves, the Russians smell, the Arabs are rapists, the Jews want our money. Deutsche, wehrt euch!"
 GER_dismantle_democracy: "Dismantle Democracy"
 GER_dismantle_democracy_desc: "The ongoing national revolution has failed to catch the hearts of minds of many of Germany's population. Foreigners, intellectuals and the pro-European middle class have united in a socio-political block against our national resurgence. Much to their detriment however, the national revolution can count on high-ranking military members. The leftist filth wants to vote us out next election? What election is that?"

 # Bundeswehr Reform

 GER_bundeswehr_reform: "Bundeswehr Reform"
 GER_bundeswehr_reform_desc: "Since the end of the Second World War, Germany's military has been severely restricted in size and scope. With the German government spending less on the military than other European powers such as France and the United Kingdom, Germany's forces face chronic supply problems and dysfunctional weapons systems. After soldiers used broomsticks rather than machine guns in a recent training exersize, the time has more than come to reform the Bundeswehr and ensure that Germany can properly defend itself."

 GER_modernized_auftragstaktik_desc: "Auftragstaktik (officially known as 'Führen mit Auftrag' or 'leading by mission') is a military tactic where the outcome of a mission is proritized over how that outcome is accomplished. Known as mission command in the United States and United Kingdom, the tactic gives greater flexibility to individual unit commanders and is compatable with modern net-centric concepts and command and control (C2)."
 GER_small_arms_grants: "A New Standard Rifle"
 GER_small_arms_grants_desc: "The German G36 rifle, made standard by the Bundeswehr in 1996 has since been found to overheat and lose accuracy in hot weather.

 GER_young_officer_class_desc: "To meet the ever-increasing demand of the German armed forces in their peacekeeping and NATO deployments across the globe, a new generation of young men and women must heed the call and serve their country to the best of their ability. We must ensure that Germany's youth are aware of the opportunities that await them in the armed forces, and train them accordingly."
 GER_vehicle_development_grants: "Vehicle Development Grants"
 GER_vehicle_development_grants_desc: "The majority of the Bundeswehr uses aging vehicles from the Cold War, many of which through years of neglect and a lack of maintainence have fallen into disrepair. We must encourage the development of a new generation of fighting vehicles to ensure our troops are better protected on the front lines."
 GER_infantry_tactics_reform: "Infantry Tactics Reform"
 GER_infantry_tactics_reform_desc: "When the First World War began, prevailing infantry combat tactics were drastically transformed. The subsequent century has seen countless advancements and innovations in the realm of infantry combat, and it is assured to continue to evolve in the century ahead. We must improve, adapt, and overcome."
 GER_modern_doctrines: "Modern Combat Doctrines"
 GER_modern_doctrines_desc: "With the modernization of our armed forces largely complete, the safety and security of the Fatherland has never looked brighter. Wir. Dienen. Deutschland."
 GER_fiscal_responsibility: "Fiscal Responsibility"
 GER_fiscal_responsibility_desc: "The 2% defense spending goal pushed upon us by our NATO allies should be upheld, however any more than is required is a waste of resources. We must be responsible and ensure that the welfare of our people is as important as the welfare of our armed forces. With a sizeable defense force and our greater ability to help our allies in foreign peacekeeping operations, Germany is both safer and richer."
 GER_influence_in_turkey: "Influence in Turkey"

 GER_military_conservatism: "Military Conservatism"
 GER_military_conservatism_desc: "The military is an essential part of the German nation. While moderates contend that the welfare of the people is as important as the military, they like to forget that without a strong, well-funded military, the people are vulnerable to external threats. A resurgent Russia, increasingly expansionist China and global terror plots only further reiterate the importance of the Bundeswehr in the 21st century."
