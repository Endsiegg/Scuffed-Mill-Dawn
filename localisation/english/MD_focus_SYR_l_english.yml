Their militias were a keyfactor in Assad's victory, and they have been gaining popularity as a political party as well. Keeping them around will ensure their militias are at Assad's service, but this will increase their influence. Purging them might lead to resistance from them later on. \nHow should we advise Assad?"

 SyriaFocus.8.t: "An Arabian Night"
 SyriaFocus.8.d: "Tonight is probably going to be one of the longest nights for the security officers of the Syrian Arab Republic. Not always the SSNP was this hostile to the Syrian as of now. But nothing can be done politically right now, Since all of the political alternatives have been tested and... most of them failed. Now, it shall be seen what would happen this night, or tommorow, to Syria, and its leadership."
 SyriaFocus.8.a: "Let us pray for the best."
 SyriaFocus.9.t: "The Inspection"
 SyriaFocus.9.d: "[Root.GetLeader] stands in front of a formation, saluting them. Scorching morning sun burns the faces of the Syrian soldiers. [Root.GetLeader] lowers his hand and walks towards the formation. He starts shaking the hands of each soldier in the first row. One by one, he greets the soldiers, and onlookers can see the pride in their faces. One particular soldier catches the eye of [Root.GetLeader]. As he shakes the hand of the soldier, it seems as if the soldier is saying something to him. An expression of horror appears on the face of [Root.GetLeader]. Merely a moment later the explosives hidden inside the soldier's jacket explode.\n\nDozens of fighters wearing the symbols of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party emerge from hiding, and start firing on the soldiers and the crowd. The Syrian security forces quickly take control of the situation and neutralise the hostiles.\n\nThe mangled body of [Root.GetLeader] is found only a few feet away from the point of explosion. Minutes later, a broadcast by the SSNP claims that 'The reign of [Root.GetLeader] has come to an end! Syria will be liberated from his dogs!'"
 SyriaFocus.9.a: "Goodnight, sweet prince"
 SyriaFocus.10.t: "The Uprising"
 SyriaFocus.10.d: "As the night falls, several explosions are heard around Damascus.

Soon after, a broadcast is heard all over Syria claiming that 'the SSNP is the only true ruler of Syria, and [Root.GetLeader] and their goons' time is over. We fight for a new Syria, which will rise from the ashes of the old'"
 SyriaFocus.10.a: "These dogs will suffer the same fate as all other rebels!"
 SyriaFocus.11.t: "The Failure"
 SyriaFocus.11.d: "Explosions are heard all over Damascus. Soldiers wearing the emblems of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or SSNP, are seen running around the streets.

 SyriaFocus.11.a: "They'll never stand a chance"
 SyriaFocus.12.t: "The Status of Palestinian Militias in Syria"
 SyriaFocus.12.desc: "Syria is a home to many Palestinians who have left their homeland. During the Syrian civil war, many of these Palestinians joined pro-Assad militias, since many Palestinians see Syria as one of the biggest supporters for a free Palestine.

 SyriaFocus.14.desc: "Despite being a religious minority, large parts of the pro-Assad forces composed of Shiite militias.

Some of them have already expresse wishes to join a new Syrian army. However, some of them will harbor loyalties to the old Assad regime, and our supporters will definitely be unhappy about cooperating with our old enemies. On the other hand, these men are experience combat veterans of the war, and their expertise might come in handy."
 SyriaFocus.19.a: "Integrate the units"
 SyriaFocus.19.b: "Better to send these men home"
 SyriaFocus.20.t: "Generals of the SAA"
 SyriaFocus.20.d: "Some of the generals of the Syrian Arab Army sit in our prisons. These men commanded Assad's forces for years against our soldiers.

 SyriaFocus.22.t: "The Status of the SSNP"
 SyriaFocus.22.d: "The SSNP, or the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, is a rising party in Syrian politics.

One offers an inclusive type of government that ensures equal representation for all basing their entire ideology on secular grounds that aim to unite the country's diverse people into a western-style democratic government with empowered parliament and liberal institutions. The other is an islamist coalition aiming to achieve what it calls a popular islamist republic that follows the islamic teachings. While not much addressing the religious diversity of the country they focused on the nostalgia of conservative rule and gathered support from zealous religious people and moderate conservatives in the country. A third powerful yet more fractured force has totally different plans based on the legacy of the previous government. The NPF or National Progressive Front has re-established itself as the torch-bearer of what they see as the true ideals and policies of the baathist rule gathering support from reform-minded baathists and nationalists aiming for a strong government that is truly capable with it's members being from the politically powerful parliamentarians of the previous government. The NPF is divided between socialists and populists the former advocating nasserism and the latter a pan-syrian nationalism. While the two parties differ they both share the same policies desired for implementation. So with the polls casted the victor is:"

We have avoided conflict with them, so we could focus on taking out the Assad regime. However, as the dust settles, our forces are starting across the border at theirs.\n\nWe could continue the civil war, and take them out. On the other hand, we could promise them representation in whatever government we will form in the future, and they will most likely demand us to hold to that promise."

Their end goal was to create a federal Syrian republic, though many see the area just as Western Kurdistan. Demanding that they submit to us will most likely lead into a civil war.

The islamist militias see now the benefits of operating under a more moderate banner as it will allow them to recieve foreign support.

Years of fighting this brutal civil war has turned most of the former FSA-forces under the sway of islamist ideology. Though we don't exactly agree with the Muslim Brotherhoods interpretation of everything, they are, inshallah, willing to fight together with us in a coordinated fashion, and at least believe in Sharia as the sole law and Islam as the only needed governance of Syria."

It is likely the possibility of recieving foreign military aid played a large role in convincing the islamists to operate under a more moderate banner."

 SyriaNews.9.t: "Collapse of the FSA - remaining rebels team up with islamists"
 SyriaNews.9.d: "With growing military pressure on the Free Syrian Army Coalition, their already shaky unity has broken completely down and the remaining militias have mostly pledged allegiance to the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham. Tahrir al-Sham, which has the former al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra-Front at it's core, have been more effective and successful on the battlefield against Assad's forces, and this added with the growing influence of radical ideology within many FSA-groups has made an large scale switch of allegiance increasingly more likely over time."
