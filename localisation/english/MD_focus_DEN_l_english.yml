If we close the Garden off from the public, the resulting expanded training areas vastly improve the effectiveness of the Academy.

 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy_desc: "At an age of more than 3 years, the Royal Danish Naval Academy has the honor of being the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world. Unfortunately, even for institutions, with age comes a sneaking decreptitude and the Naval Academy could really use some restructuring."
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR: "Establish OPLOG KOR"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR_desc: "OPLOG KOR, short for Operative Logistical Support Korsør, is the local support infrastructure for our naval base in Korsør, FLS KOR.

 DEN_establish_VFK_desc: "Our Joint Services Defense Command, or 'Værnsfælles Forsvarskommando', will be the supreme authority of Danish Defence, spanning all three main branches of the Danish armed forces.

 DEN_early_fighter_models: "Early Fighter Models"

 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school_desc: "The Royal Danish Air Force Officers School is the youngest of our great military academies, but is still lagging hopelessly behind other countries' air forces.

 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base: "Expand Skalstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base_desc: "Our air base near Roskilde was previously armed with NIKE rockets and HAWK batteries that contributed massively to our anti-air capabilities on Zealand and whose prime directive was the protection of Copenhagen from air bombardments.

Karup needs to be protected, to be respected - and perhaps even to be expanded."
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production: "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc: "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircraft for the Air Force home.

The Liberals seem poised to take the lead and become the largest political party on the right, if not overall, and though in reality this will most likely merely mean cuts to the funding of the welfare state, rather than outright dismantlement, it is being viewed as a minarchist declaration of war on the Nordic Model."

 denmark.11.d: "It seems the patriotic groups on the extreme right have been able to put their ideological differences aside and formed a united front for [DEN.GetAdjective] nationalists. These usually disparate groups have been united in a common belief in the superiority of the nation of [DEN.GetName] to all other nations in the world, and a strong belief that the new [DEN.GetName] should right the many wrongs that the world has inflicted on the nation throughout the [DEN.GetAdjective] history.\n\nThe rhetoric of these groups are already cause for concern for several of the neighbours of [DEN.GetName], who, historically, the [DEN.GetAdjective] have plenty of reasons to carry a grudge against."

 denmark.12.d: "It seems that the nationalist groups on the extreme right have acquiesced and been incorporated into the National Socialist Movement of Denmark. This marks a surprising move for the, formerly very small and obscure, movement of Danish nazis, who are now experiencing a rapid growth in members. Some political commentators have remarked that if this development continues we might see the strongest presence of fascism in Denmark since Frits Clausen led the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark during the Occupation in the 194's."

Today it is clear that the hardliners calling for armed insurrection won and reports are already coming in of violent assaults on bankers and politicians in Copenhagen. Meanwhile the moderate voices in the Revolutionary Committee are reported missing, rumoured to be either dead or in hiding. One political commentator bitterly remarked that it seems the revolution is destined to be a bloody one and only time will tell whether it will be worth it in the end."
