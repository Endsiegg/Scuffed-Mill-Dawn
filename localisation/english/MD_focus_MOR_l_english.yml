 morocco.400.t: "The Casablanca Bombings"
 morocco.400.d: "Early today several bombings have taken place across several sites in the city of Casablanca. Twelve suicide bombers with bombs placed in their backpacks set off explosions in the Casa de España, Hotel Farah, the Jewish Alliance of Casablanca, and several other sites near the Belgian consulate and the old Jewish cemetery. The attacks claimed the lives of forty-five people including the twelve suicide bombers and injured at least a hundred more civilians. It is speculated the recent rise of Salafist preachers in the country, many of whom are veterans of the Soviet-Afghan War, have begun to radicalize more and more as time progresses. The GCIM and al-Qaeda have declared their responsibility for the attacks with the attack being targeted towards Jews in the city despite none of the victims being Jewish. Some local groups are stating that this is due to the rise of what is known as \"Shanty Towns\" in the city paving the way for radicalization amongst the impoverished people of the city and Morocco."
