 PER_nuclear_compromise.1.d: "[PER.GetName] was one of the original 62 signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the most important global treaty on the world’s deadliest weapon. It went into effect in 1970 and has been the standard of nuclear arms control ever since. However, that decision was made by the Shah's U.S.-aligned government prior to the glorious 1979 Revolution, and it would benefit our people greatly to have such weapons, something which the Shah never considered. However, it has been said that we apporach this with tact, and via diplomatic channels, rather than without international permission. First and foremost, we must approach the Americans, or do we?"

They say that [PER.GetName] is pursuing a compromise with us on the NPT, in return for reopening official diplomatic channels, the reopening of our embassy in Tehran, offering us bases in their country, and allowing us to oversee the nuclear project. This is an extremely tempting offer, as this would allow our Middle Eastern foreign policy to focus on peacekeeping and combating [SOV.GetName], rather than combating both [PER.GetName] and [SOV.GetName].

They do not come empty-handed, and they are offering the partial denationalization of the National Iranian Oil Company, previously known as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

Our Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance drafted up a report on the additional cost, with the resulting increase being an extra 10 billion minimum to assuage fears of lackluster care.

With this assurance, the Deendayal Port Authority, along with the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways have vocalized their support for the idea, citing that the excess could be used in the development of the Kandla port via the addition of four multipurpose cargo berths, as it is the largest port by volume, and the addition of said four berths is planned to increase the current cargo capacity of the port by 8 million tonnes. Both the authority and the ministry have made formal requests to the Prime Minister to accept the deal, citing the need to decongest the port."

Citing the risk to the citizens of Kandla, they request either a higher amount for the creation of even safer facilities, or to end discussions. While the Ministry of Finance is unwilling to cough out more money, the Ministry of Defense reminds us that using Kandla would ultimately guarentee that foreign powers would not interfer with the transfer from Korea.

They are offering 20 billion, not just for the assurance of safety, but also for the development of Kandla's port facilities. This is a very tempting offer, with both the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry breathing down everyone's neck, urging us to take this deal. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Iranians are deperate for this deal, and would probably offer more if we deny a third time. The Ministry of PSW disagrees, and believes that any more shenanigans would lead to this deal falling through, and that we should take it."

According to western sources, the two RCBs were on a transit from Kuwait to Bahrain, leaving Kuwait at 12:23 p.m local time, and were scheduled to refuel with the USCGC Monomoy at 5 p.m. During the transit one RCB developed an \"engine problem\", and both boats stopped to solve the mechanical issue.
