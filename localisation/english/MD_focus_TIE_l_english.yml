He then served under Goukouni Oueddei, and eventually helped him be overthrown by Hissène Habré. He then served as one of the most seasoned commanders of Chad in the Chadian-Libyan conflict. After Habré was ousted by the rebels of Idriss Déby, Nouri once again switched sides. However, now Nouri has chosen a different path as he has received the opportunity to lead the Toubou as an independent nation."

Oueddei continued fighting Habré as a Libyan-backed rebel leader during the Chadian-Libyan conflict. In 1985, he was put under house arrest by the Libyan police as he was suspected of trying to negotiate a truce with the Chadians. A few months later, he was shot in the stomach as the Libyan police tried to arrest him. Two years later, he moved to Algeria, though he still claimed to be on good terms with the Libyans.

 TIE_tibesti_fortress: "The Tibesti Mountain Fortress"

 TIE_break_clan_structure: "Break Clan Structure"
 TIE_break_clan_structure_desc: "The Toubou people are divided into clans. In the vast deserts of the Sahel, this is a necessity to always have a safe haven where to go.

We need to encourage some kind of common identity, like nation, religion or culture to bring people together without the need for clans."
 TIE_large_scale_farming: "Large Scale Farming"

In 1966, the Chadian government killed four of the five sons of the then Derde Oueddei Kichidemi and forced him to exile. This sparked the 1st Chadian Civil War.

 TIE_use_azza_to_industrialise: "Use The Azza To Industrialise"
 TIE_use_azza_to_industrialise_desc: "The Toubou society is socially stratified into a caste system. The people who work instead of owning land and herding are called the Azza.

We should not despise these people, but instead use them to create actual industry for the Toubou people."

It used to be used as an ingredient in soap, mouthwash, toothpaste, antiseptics, insecticide and in leather making.
