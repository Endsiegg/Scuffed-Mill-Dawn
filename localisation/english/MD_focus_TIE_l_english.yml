 #Ideas
 TIE_pastoral_culture: "Nomadic Culture"

 TIE_soborom_hot_springs_desc: "The Soborom Hot Springs are a series of hot springs with fumaroles and mud volcanoes located in the Western part of the Tibesti Mountains. Many Toubou believe the springs to have healing properties, and as such it is a popular place to seek remedy to illness."
 TIE_clan_structure: "Clan Structure"
 TIE_clan_structure_desc: "The Toubou society is build on clans. Each clan owns certain pastures, wells and oases. After their family, each Toubou identifies with their clan the second. In the vast deserts of the Sahel, having a clan means you will find a friendly face in almost anywhere you go. The clan system does however undermine the state's authority, but on the other hand any invader will find it difficult to subdue the Toubou as there is no single authority to negotiate with."
 TIE_sharia_law: "Sharia Law"

 TIE_punching_above: "Toubou Political Influence"

Nouri fought as a member of the FROLINAT rebel group in the 1st Chadian Civil War, to topple the then president François Tombalbaye (the 1st President of Chad) with support from Libya. He then served under Goukouni Oueddei, and eventually helped him be overthrown by Hissène Habré. He then served as one of the most seasoned commanders of Chad in the Chadian-Libyan conflict. After Habré was ousted by the rebels of Idriss Déby, Nouri once again switched sides. However, now Nouri has chosen a different path as he has received the opportunity to lead the Toubou as an independent nation."
 Goukouni_Oueddei_desc: "Oueddei started as the leading commander of FROLINAT, a rebel group that toppled the then President of Felix Malloum of Chad with the help of Libya. Oueddei was made president, but was soon betrayed by his ally Hissène Habré, who opposed Libya's influence in the country. Oueddei continued fighting Habré as a Libyan-backed rebel leader during the Chadian-Libyan conflict. In 1985, he was put under house arrest by the Libyan police as he was suspected of trying to negotiate a truce with the Chadians. A few months later, he was shot in the stomach as the Libyan police tried to arrest him. Two years later, he moved to Algeria, though he still claimed to be on good terms with the Libyans. Oueddei is the son of Oueddei Kichidemi, the last derde of the Toubou."

 TIE_tibesti_fortress: "The Tibesti Mountain Fortress"

 TIE_local_military_production: "Local Weapons Production"
 TIE_local_military_production_desc: "Making weapons locally should not be that difficult. The Taliban do it in the mountains of Afghanistan. The FARC do it in the jungles of Colombia. Why would we not be able to do it in the deserts of the Sahara?"

 TIE_break_clan_structure: "Break Clan Structure"
 TIE_break_clan_structure_desc: "The Toubou people are divided into clans. In the vast deserts of the Sahel, this is a necessity to always have a safe haven where to go.

We need to encourage some kind of common identity, like nation, religion or culture to bring people together without the need for clans."
 TIE_large_scale_farming: "Large Scale Farming"

In 1966, the Chadian government killed four of the five sons of the then Derde Oueddei Kichidemi and forced him to exile. This sparked the 1st Chadian Civil War. The Derde then became a political and military symbol of the Toubou as the rebel group FROLINAT was led by the Derde's only remaining son, Goukouni Oueddei. We need to elect a new Derde to act as the leading judicial authority over the clans."
 TIE_punch_above_our_weight: "Punch Above Our Weight"

 TIE_share_oasis: "Share Oases"
 TIE_share_oasis_desc: "All resources are shared between the clans. We should do a survey of oases, wells and pastures and redistribute them if we see inequality between any two clans. This will strengthen our people's belief that the clan system works."
 TIE_use_azza_to_industrialise: "Use The Azza To Industrialise"
 TIE_use_azza_to_industrialise_desc: "The Toubou society is socially stratified into a caste system. The people who work instead of owning land and herding are called the Azza. These people do artisanal work, mining, metal work and tailoring, and have traditionally been despised and segregated by the higher caste of 'freemen' of the Toubou society. We should not despise these people, but instead use them to create actual industry for the Toubou people."

 TIE_mine_natron_desc: "Natron is a salt like substance found in old dried up lakes. It used to be used as an ingredient in soap, mouthwash, toothpaste, antiseptics, insecticide and in leather making. However, in modern times it has been replaced mostly by soda ash in almost all applications. Our people still mine it and use it for their own domestic goods.

 TIE_trans_saharan_trade_libya: "Trans-Saharan Trade Route To [LBA.GetName]"
 TIE_trans_saharan_trade_libya_desc: "The main export of [LBA.GetNameDef] is oil. Unfortunately, we have not been so lucky with finding oil in our country. Perhaps with the [LBA.GetAdjective] National Oil Corporation we will be able to find some?"

 TIE_import_tourists_desc: "There are many natural wonders to see in the Tibesti Mountains, such as the $TIE_soborom_hot_springs$. We need to use our ties with a Western country to kick-start a tourism boom."
