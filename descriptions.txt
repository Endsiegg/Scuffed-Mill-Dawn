With the dawn of a new millennium, a new chapter in human history is about to be written. Globalization continues to change the lives of countless billions while rising extremism is showing signs of igniting the fires of conflict. New powers begin to emerge, and not all believe their place in the global order, or that of some competitors, is warranted. A struggle will soon begin, and it will likely change everything. Will you lead your Nation to prosperity and dominance in the decades ahead, or will your Nation fall victim to the defining moments of history?

[b][i]Welcome to Millennium Dawn.[/i][/b]

Millennium Dawn is a multi-mod project set in 2000 and continues to the modern day and beyond. The mod boasts new and unique tech trees, focus trees, events, and decisions to immerse you in the intricacies of the modern era.

Further, it offers a new and unique economic system, a new political system, national taxation and debt, custom internal political factions, international influence mechanics, custom 3D models, a custom soundtrack, and much more!
