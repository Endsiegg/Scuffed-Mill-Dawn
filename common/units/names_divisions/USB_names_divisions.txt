#This list is based upon following priorities:
#1, existing BCTs, through numbered Div.s with lone BCT sized forces coming last
#2, adding recently deactivated 4th BCTs to existing Div.s - 4th/25th ID is kept separate in the airborne list. See below for why.
#3, adding 3rd BCTs to existing Div.s
#4, Div.s according to the US Army reflagging system. These only have 3 BCTs however, as the 4th BCTs were largely added after their deactivation.
#
#As Div.s today have units from all different kinds of branches, this list is organized along the rule of all units of a branch, say armored, are sorted first.
#But as the US reflaggs units, I have also copied in the other branch units in so they are under the same identity code, so they can be switched.
#
#As for infantry vs Armored for ordering of the potential reflagging Div.s, prio is amount of battalions of the branch.
#If equal, however, they are ordered according to the Div. designation.
#A few BCTs of the reflagging Div.s are high numbered and today act as training Div.s. I have included them here as combat units under the appropriate Div..
#
#Units that are separate are mountain and airborne - as they hold unique roles. This is to make the game easier. They also haven't been reflagged before.
#However, Airborne and Air Assault lists are the same, as the BCTs are both called 'Airborne'.
